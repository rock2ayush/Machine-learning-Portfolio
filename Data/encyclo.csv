"• Bull and bear market statistics for complete coverage."
"• Expanded statistics, all in a similar format:"
"Results Snapshot, at the start of each chapter shows the most"
"important numbers and surprises."
"General statistics, including the average rise or decline, busted"
"pattern performance, and benchmark performance."
"Failure rates, a list of ten breakpoints to show how often a pattern"
"fails."
"Breakout and postbreakout statistics, showing performance"
"over the yearly price range, pullback rates, and performance after a"
"gap."
"Frequency distribution of days to the ultimate high or low,"
"showing when the trend is likely to end."
"Size statistics, describing how performance varies for pattern"
"height, width, and combinations of both."

"• Event patterns. I added 9 new types of patterns, which I call event pat-"

"• More samples. I found over 38,500 chart pattern samples, more than"
"double the 15,000 used in the first edition, making many of the statis-"

"• Keyed table entries. Each table entry appears in bold at the start of its"

"When I was a little tyke I decided the easiest way to riches was to play the stock"
"market. It was, after all, a level playing field, a negative-sum game with some-"
"body winning and somebody losing. (Hint: The winner is always the broker.)"
"All one had to do to win was pick stocks that went up and avoid stocks that"
"went down. Easy."
"I kept this in mind when I graduated from Syracuse University with an"
"engineering degree and showed up early for my first professional job. Each"
"morning I cracked open the newspaper and plotted my stock picks on a piece"
"of graph paper taped to the wall. Bob, my office mate, used the same newspa-"
"per to select his stocks. I chose my selections after exhausting fundamental"
"research, but Bob simply closed his eyes, twirled his hand around, and plunged"
"his finger into the newspaper. When he opened his eyes and removed his fin-"
"ger, he announced another pick."
"After several months of tracking both our selections, I made a startling"
"discovery: I was getting creamed. Bob’s random selections were beating the tar"
"out of my carefully researched choices. I also discovered something else: I was"
"learning a lot by paper trading."
"With the hesitancy and distrust inherited from my parents, I studied two"
"dozen firms before making my final selection and first purchase: I opened a"
"money market account. The timing was excellent; I was earning over 17% on"
"my cash. At first glance, the return might imply a very risky investment but it"
"was not. The prime rate was, after all, at 21%."
"Flush with success, I gathered my courage and opened a brokerage"
"account and began investing the few pennies I saved. Again, the timing was"
"excellent as I caught the beginning of a major bull market. I bought a stock at"
"a split-adjusted price of 88 cents and watched it go to $30 and change."
"Lest you think that everything was easy, consider what happened. My"
"stock portfolio was growing by leaps and bounds, but my professional career"
"was about to take a turn for the worse. After switching careers more often than"

"I sometimes like to admit, I landed a job with a company I could finally call"
"home—a job that would last a lifetime, or so I hoped. Almost 6 months after"
"my 10-year anniversary with the company, I received a letter from the chair-"
"man. He congratulated me on my decade with the company and looked for-"
"ward to even more success for me in the coming years."
"Six weeks later I was laid off."
"I took stock of the situation and decided that, at the age of 36, I had"
"enough. Newspapers term guys like me The Missing Million. We are the ones"
"who, for whatever reason, leave their jobs and decide not to go back into the"
"workforce. We retire. Everyone, and I mean everyone (with the notable excep-"
"tion of my cousin Mary Ann—bless her heart), thinks we are nuts. They are"
"right, of course!"
"For the longest time, I have been fascinated with technical analysis of"
"stocks. In the early years, I considered the little squiggles to be nothing short"
"of voodoo. Still, I was curious as to why the major brokerage houses were hir-"
"ing technical analysts in droves. But I did not dare take my eye off the funda-"
"mentals simply because I did not know anything about the technicals. Then I"
"discovered Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine. During my"
"lunch hour, I would take the elevator down to the library and read back issues."
"Although I saw chart patterns in the stocks I bought, I never really attached"
"much significance to them. As some of my selections went sour, I began to view"
"chart patterns with more respect. The fundamentals always looked good, but"
"the technicals were signaling a trend change just as I was about to pull the trig-"
"ger. The stocks I bought either lost money outright or I sold them too soon"
"and cut my profits short."
"Perhaps this has happened to you. You do fundamental research on a stock"
"and then buy it, only to watch it go nowhere for a year or more. Even worse,"
"once you get in, the stock tumbles. Had you looked at the chart the answer was"
"always there. Prices pierced a trend line, a head-and-shoulders top appeared"
"out of nowhere, the relative strength index signaled an overbought situation. In"
"short, any number of technical indicators were screaming that a buy now"
"would cost you your shirt. But you never saw the signs."
"You are not alone; I did the same thing for years. I eventually got so frus-"
"trated with the performance of my stock selections that I decided to do my own"
"research on technical analysis. I went to the library and read the same thing in"
"many books: A head-and-shoulders formation works most of the time. What"
"does that mean? Does it mean they are successful 51% of the time or 90% of"
"the time? No one had the answer. I was not willing to risk my hard-earned dol-"
"lars on simple bromides. As an engineer I wanted hard, cold facts, not fuzzy"
"platitudes. So, I wrote this book."
"At the back of the book is an Index of Chart Patterns. If you suspect your"
"stock is making a chart pattern but do not know what to call it, the Index of"

"Chart Patterns is the first place to look. Page numbers beside each pattern"
"direct you to the associated chapter."
"The chapters are arranged alphabetically in two sections; chart patterns"
"and event patterns. Within each chapter, you are first greeted with a “Results"
"Snapshot” of the major findings followed by a short discussion. Then, a"
"“Tour” invites you to explore the chart pattern. “Identification Guidelines,” in"
"both table form and in-depth discussion, make selecting and verifying your"
"choices easier."
"No work would be complete without an exploration of the mistakes, and"
"the “Focus on Failures” section dissects the cause of failures. The all-important"
"“Statistics” section follows. How do you trade a chart pattern? That is what the"
"“Trading Tactics” and “Sample Trade” sections explore. The “For Best Per-"
"formance” section includes a list of tips and observations on how to select bet-"
"ter performing patterns."
"If you have ever worked on a car or done some woodworking, then you"
"will recognize the importance of selecting the right tool for the job. You would"
"not want to use a flat-head screwdriver when a Phillips works better. Both do"
"the job but they are hardly interchangeable. Sometimes it is not a screwdriver"
"you should be using, but a chisel. Selecting the proper tools and knowing how"
"to use them is half the battle. This book is a lot like that, helping to sort the"
"wheat from the chaff. Sometimes a chart pattern is frightening enough that you"
"will want to take profits. At other times, the best trade that you can make is"
"none at all."
"I cannot give you the experience needed to make money in the stock mar-"
"ket using chart patterns. I can only give you the tools and say, “Go to work on"
"paper first.” That is the first step in developing a trading style that works for"
"you, one you are comfortable with, one that improves as you do. If you review"
"your paper trades, you will understand why a stop-loss order is more than a"
"tool for the professionals. You will improve your ability to predict support and"
"resistance levels that will, in turn, allow you to tighten your stops and get out"
"near the top, cut your losses short, and let your profits run. You will under-"
"stand why the statistics in this book are useful for comparison purposes, but"
"your trading results may fall short. You may discover that your girlfriend loves"
"diamonds, but as a chart pattern, they are a lousy investment. One word says it"
"all. Experience."
"Good luck."

"Jim is struggling."
"He is the owner of JCB Superstores and his competitor across town is"
"beating him up; there is blood all over Jim’s ledger. He decides it is time to take"
"off the gloves: JCB goes public. He uses the money from the initial public"
"offering to buy his competitor and add a few more stores around town."
"With a growing sales base, Jim’s clout allows him to negotiate lower"
"prices for the office supplies he is retailing. He passes on part of the savings to"
"his customers, while watching his margins widen, and plows the profits back"
"into building more stores."
"Jim calls his friend, Tom, and tells him of his plans to expand the opera-"
"tion statewide. They chat for a while and exchange business tactics on how best"
"to manage the expansion. When Tom gets off the phone, he decides to con-"
"duct his own research on JCB. He visits several stores and sees the same thing:"
"packed parking lots, people bustling around with full shopping carts, and lines"
"at the checkout counters. He questions a few customers to get a sense of the"
"demographics. At a few stores, he even chats with suppliers as they unload their"
"wares. Back at the office, he does a thorough analysis of the financials and"
"looks at the competition. Everything checks out so he orders his trading part-"
"ners to buy the stock at no higher than 10."
"When news of the expansion plan hits the wires, the Street panics. It is,"
"after all, a soft economy and expanding willy-nilly when a recession looms is"
"daft, maybe even criminal, according to the pundits. The stock drops below 10"
"and Tom’s crew makes its move. They buy as much as they can without rais-"
"ing suspicion. The stock rises anyway. It goes back up to 11, then 12, and"
"rounds over at 13 before heading back down."

"Several months go by and the economic outlook is as bleak as ever. The"
"stock eases down to 9. After Tom checks in with Jim for the latest public news,"
"Tom’s team buys more. It is an easy score because investors are willing to"
"dump the stock, especially as year-end tax selling approaches."
"Six weeks later the company releases the sales numbers for JCB; they are"
"better than expected. The stock rises 15% in minutes and closes at 10.75. And that"
"is just for starters. Six months later, it’s clear the economy was never in danger of"
"entering a recession and everyone sees boom times ahead. The stock hits 20."
"Years go by, the stock splits a few times, and the holiday season looms."
"Tom interviews a handful of customers leaving JCB Superstores and discovers"
"that they are all complaining about the same thing: The advertised goods are"
"not on the shelves. Tom investigates further and discovers a massive distribu-"
"tion problem, right at the height of the selling season. JCB has overextended"
"itself; the infrastructure is simply not there to support the addition of one new"
"store each week."
"Tom realizes it is time to sell. He tells his trading department to dump"

"The Database"
"For this book, I used several databases in which to search for chart patterns. The"
"main database consists of 500 stocks, each with durations of 5 years beginning"
"4    Introduction"
""
"from mid-1991. I included the 30 Dow Jones industrials and familiar names"
"with varying market capitalizations. Stocks included in the database needed"
"a heartbeat (that is, they were not unduly flat over the 5-year period) and"
"did not have consistently large intraday price swings (too thinly traded"
"or volatile)."
"I usually removed stocks that went below $1.00, assuming bankruptcy"
"was right around the corner. Most of the names in the database are popular"
"American companies that trade on the NYSE, AMEX, or Nasdaq. The numer-"
"ous illustrations accompanying each chapter give a representative sample of the"
"stocks involved."
"To capture the bear market of 2000–2002 and expand on the bull mar-"
"ket since 1996, I included two additional databases. The first uses about 200"
"stocks that I follow daily. The other contains about 300 stocks that I no longer"
"follow but that have historical data of limited duration (some issues no"
"longer trade)."
"For rare chart patterns, I use all three databases and search from 1991 to"
"the most recent date available. For plentiful patterns, I use already found pat-"
"terns and add those appearing during the bear market. Thus, the number of"
"stocks I use to find patterns and the amount of historical price quotes varies."
"In the first edition of this book, I used a combination of computerized"
"algorithms and manual searching to find chart patterns. The current edition"
"includes the 15,000 patterns from the first edition and others found manually"
"since then, for a total of more than 38,500 patterns."

"Stock Performance from 1991 to 2004"
"Before reading about the various chart patterns in this book, it is wise to review"
"the performance of the stock market during the period. Figure I.1 shows a"
"monthly price chart of the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. Beginning in"
"mid-1991, you can see that the market moved up at a leisurely pace, pausing"
"during much of 1994, and then resuming the climb at a steeper angle in 1995."
"The index stumbled in August 1998 and made lower lows for 2 more months"
"before continuing upward, peaking in March 2000, and signaling an end to the"
"bull market. The move capped a rise of 418% from the start of the period."
"After that, the downhill bear run began, reaching a low in October 2002, for a"
"decline measuring 51%. The index bounced once but made a higher low in"
"March 2003, signaling a trend change. Thus, the October low marked the end"
"of the bear market."
"What does all this mean? The bear market measures from March 24,"
"2000, to October 10, 2002—about 2.5 years long. For data collection pur-"
"poses, the bull market is everything else, about 11 years long. That covers the"

"I could give a dentist’s drill to any person walking by, but that doesn’t mean I"
"would let that person near my teeth. This book is just like that. It gives you the"
"tools to invest successfully. It suggests which chart patterns work best and which"
"ones to avoid. Whether you can make money using them is entirely up to you."
"I call this book an encyclopedia because that is how I use it. Whenever I"
"see a chart pattern forming in a stock I own, or am thinking of buying, I read"
"the applicable chapter. The information refreshes my memory about identifi-"
"cation quirks, performance, and any tips on how I can get in sooner or more"
"profitably. Then I search for similar patterns in the same stock (using different"
"time scales), and if that does not work, I search for similar patterns in stocks in"
"the same industry. I look at them closely to determine if their secrets are"

"Developing an Investment Style"
"The question I am asked most often is, how do I develop an investment style? It is"
"usually not asked like that. Most take a more direct approach: How do I make"
"money trading stocks? When first asked this question, I stumbled over the"
"answer. I think it is like showing four people the color blue and asking them to"
"6    Introduction"
""
"describe it. One person is color blind so you automatically throw out whatever"
"he says. One says it is solid blue. Another says it is not blue at all but green,"
"while the third says it looks like a combination: blue-green. To each individ-"
"ual, blue looks like blue—just do not try to compare answers."
"Developing a trading style is a lot like that. It is an individual endeavor"
"that has a lot in common with experience. I cannot give you experience; I can"
"only suggest ways to acquire your own."
"If you read a chapter on a bullish chart pattern and buy the first stock"
"showing the pattern in a bull market, you will probably be successful. The first"
"trade nearly always works for the novice, maybe even the second or third one,"
"too. Eventually, though, someone is going to pull the rug out from under you"
"(who knows, maybe it occurs on the first trade). You will make an investment in"
"a chart pattern and the trade will go bad. Maybe you will stumble across a herd"
"of bad trades and get flattened. You might question your sanity, you might"
"question God, but one thing is for certain: Your trading style is not working."
"Most people buy stocks like they buy fruit. They look at it, perhaps sniff"
"it, and plunk down their money. We are not talking about $1.59 here. We are"
"talking about thousands of dollars for part ownership in a company."
"If you have ever been a board member, you know what I am talking about."
"You have a fiduciary responsibility to the people who elected or appointed you"
"to that position. Not only should you study the material handed to you by the"
"staff, but you have to get out in the field and kick the tires. Do not assume that"
"what the staff says is always correct or represents the best solution. Question"
"everything but learn in the process and try to be helpful without being a pest"
"(I always seem to fall into the pest category). As a shareholder—an owner of the"
"company—should it be any different?"
"Once, I considered buying a position in a company showing an upward"
"breakout from a symmetrical triangle. My computer program told me the com-"
"pany is a member of the machinery industry and further research revealed that"
"it makes refractory products. I continued doing research on the company until"
"the problem gnawing at me finally sank in. I did not have the slightest idea"

"ting the sort of warm fuzzies I usually get when researching a possible invest-"

"understand or explain in a paragraph. Good advice."
"Of course, if you blindly invest in chart squiggles and it works for you,"
"who am I to tell you you are doing it wrong? The fact is, you are not. If you"
"consistently make money at it, then you have developed an investment style"
"that fits your personality. Good for you!"
"My investment style, as you might have guessed, combines fundamental"
"analysis, technical analysis, emotional analysis, and money management. Just"
"because I rely on technical analysis does not mean I do not look at the price-"

"trations or trying to impress her with the size of my wallet? That is where"
"paper trading comes in handy. I can experiment on new techniques without"
"getting burned. If I do the simulation accurately enough, my subconscious will"
"not know the difference, and I will learn a lot in the process."
"Once I come to terms with any emotional issues, I look at money man-"
"agement. How much can I realistically expect to make, and how much can I"
"lose? What is the proper lot size to take? When should I add to my position?"
"How long will it take for the stock to reach my target and should I invest in a"
"less promising but quicker candidate?"
"Investing using chart formations is an exercise in probability. If you play"
"the numbers long enough, you will win out. Sure, some of your investments"
"will fail, and you must learn to cut your losses before they get out of hand. But"
"the winners should serve you well, providing you let them ride. Just do not"

"Day Traders, Position Traders, Buy-and-Hold Investors"
"As I was writing this book, I kept asking myself what is the time horizon for chart"
"patterns? Are they best for day traders, position traders, or buy-and-hold"
"investors? The answer I kept coming up with is: Yes! Chart formations can be"
"profitable for day traders—those people who are in and out of a trade during a"
"single day. Many day traders have trading styles that depend on chart forma-"
"tions, support, and resistance. They concentrate on reliable formations that"
"quickly fulfill their measure rule predictions."
"For position traders, those who hold the trade longer than a day but not"
"forever, chart patterns offer convenient entry and exit signals. I put myself in"
"this category. If the trade goes bad, I am out quickly. If it is profitable, I see no"
"need to cut my profits short. When the gains plateau, or if the stock has moved"
"about all it is going to, I consider moving on. Like the day trader, I try to keep"
"cash employed by buying formations that promise reliable returns and reach"
"the ultimate high quickly."
"For the long-term investor, chart patterns also signal good entry and exit"

"Most of the sample trades included in the chapters of this book are fictitious."

"Statistics: “I Don’t Believe the Numbers”"
"A high, tight flag has an average rise of 69% in a bull market. Question: If you"
"trade this pattern often enough in a bull market, will you make an average of"
"69%? Answer: No. Why not? Well, you may be like a friend of mine who has"
"traded stocks a dozen times but made money only once (a few hundred bucks)."
"But here is another reason: The 69% average rise represents 253 perfect trades."
"A perfect trade is one in which you buy at the breakout price and sell at the ulti-"
"mate high—the highest high before prices decline by at least 20%. Not only"
"are the trades perfect, but also commissions are not included. Your return may"
"be lower . . . or higher. However, I used the same spreadsheet formulas from"
"pattern to pattern, so you can compare performance in most cases (the excep-"
"tions: flags, measured moves, and pennants) without worrying about whether"
"you believe the numbers."
"“If I reproduce your tests, will I get similar results?” Yes. A person in"
"India I know is pulling 30%, 40%, and more out of the market on a consistent"
"basis. He would claim my statistics are too conservative! A hedge fund manager"
"reports that my numbers for the dead-cat bounce are dead solid perfect."

"methods I used, your results will vary. Guaranteed. So, this edition includes a"
"Glossary and Methodology chapter to explain how I measured each result."
"The method I used opened a door to a new world. In this world, you will"
"find that a month after a breakout in a bear market, price often shows strength."
"You will discover that when pullbacks occur, performance suffers. You will find"
"that failure rates start low but increase rapidly. Volume shapes, price gaps, pat-"
"tern size, and a dozen other performance clues help some patterns but not oth-"

"slope down. The diverging trend lines distinguish the broadening bottom from"
"other types of formations, such as the right-angled broadening formation"
"(which has one horizontal trend line) or the broadening wedge (both trend"
"lines slope in the same direction). So it is important that each trend line has a"
"slope that is opposite the other."
"Touches. A broadening bottom needs at least two minor highs and two"
"minor lows to be a valid formation. Anything fewer means you are incorrectly"
"identifying the formation. What is a minor high or low? A minor high is when"
"prices trend up, then drop back down, leaving a clearly defined peak. A minor"
"low is just the same thing flipped upside down: Prices move lower, then head"
"back up leaving a clearly defined valley. Figure 1.1 shows five minor highs or"
"lows, labeled by numbers. The odd numbers tag the minor highs and the even"
"numbers are the minor lows. Let me stress that the minor highs and lows need"
"not be alternating, as in Figure 1.1. Just as long as you can count at least two"
"peaks and two valleys—wherever they may appear—that is fine."
"Volume. There is nothing magical in the volume trend. I performed lin-"
"ear regression from the start of each formation to the end point (not the break-"
"out point that is usually a month beyond the end of the formation) and found"
"that volume rises about 57% of the time."

"times follows price. In Figure 1.1, the price decline between peak 1 and trough"
"2 shows a receding volume trend. When prices head up from point 2 to point 3,"
"so does volume. If you were to place a thin wooden plank between the volume"
"peaks in late November and late January, it would bow downward in a U shape."
"A U-shaped volume pattern occurs slightly more often than other shapes."
"Breakout. The breakout point is difficult to identify in a broadening for-"
"mation as it develops. I look for the place where price pierces the up or down"
"trend line or makes an extended move. If price pierces the trend line, then the"
"penetration point becomes the breakout point. If prices move up and follow"
"along the top trend line without piercing it, then I backtrack to the prior minor"
"high and draw a horizontal line forward in time until prices cross it. When that"
"happens, that is the breakout point."
"Let me give you an example. Consider the broadening bottom shown in"
"Figure 1.2. The price trend over the preceding month leading to the formation"
"is downward. The two trend lines outline a widening price pattern as you"
"would expect from a broadening formation. There are more than two minor"
"highs and two minor lows pictured, meeting another criterion mentioned"
"in Table 1.1."
"Where is the breakout? This formation is particularly easy. If you extend"
"the top trend line upward, you find that prices rise well above the line, signal-"
"ing an upward breakout. Then it is just a matter of backtracking to the highest"
"minor high and drawing a horizontal line to determine the actual breakout"
"price. Point A marks the highest high in the formation."

"a slave to her computer masters. She is an active position trader who is not"
"afraid to short a stock, given good profit potential and an especially weak fun-"

"When she spotted the broadening bottom shown in Figure 1.4, she began"

"and has been heading down ever since. Now, with the stock trading at 14, she"

"wondered how much downside remained. She drew the two trend-line bound-"
"aries and counted the number of alternating touches (in Figure 1.4, three are"
"labeled as numbers and Point A is the fourth alternating touch)."
"Since most broadening formations tend to break out after four alternat-"
"ing touches and since the price was near the top of the formation heading"
"down, she guessed that the stock would break out downward on the next cross-"
"ing. So she sold the stock short and received a fill at 13.88. It was a gamble,"
"sure, but one she was comfortable making. In any case, she immediately placed"
"a stop at 14.25, or slightly above the high at point A."

"to the other side of the formation, touching the bottom trend line at point B."
"Usually, her trades are not that easy. She decided to protect her profit and low-"
"ered the stop to the nearest minor high, shown as point C, at 13.75 or 0.15"
"above the high. Then she waited."
"The stock bounced off the lower trend line instead of busting through as"
"she hoped. She decided to be patient and see what the stock did next. With her"
"stop-loss order in place at the break-even price, she felt protected and com-"
"fortable in letting the trade ride."
"The stock bounced off the 12 support level and did a partial rise before"
"meeting resistance and heading back down. Two days after cresting, she made"
"the determination that on the next touch, the stock would pierce the lower"
"trend line and continue down. She doubled her stake by selling more stock"
"short at 12.75. She was wrong. The stock continued down 1 more day before"
"moving up again. Susan adjusted her stop-loss order to include the additional"
"shares, but kept it at the same price level (13.75). Again she waited. The stock"
"slowly climbed and reached a minor high of 13.13 before heading down again."
"This time the decline was strong enough to punch through the support zone"
"at the lower trend line."
"When the stock descended below point B, Susan lowered her stop-loss"
"order to 0.15 above that point or 12.15. Then she looked at the measure rule"
"for the price target. She calculated a target of 9.88 and wondered if the stock"
"would really reach that price. To be safe, she decided to cash out if the stock"
"reached 10.15, or 0.15 above the common support price of 10 (a whole num-"
"ber typically shows support)."
"When the stock plunged to 10.38 on high volume, she wondered if she"
"was looking at a one-day reversal chart pattern. With those formations, it is"
"difficult to be sure if prices would reverse or not. She decided to hold on to her"
"original target."
"Two days later, prices zoomed upward and her stop closed out the trade"
"at 12.15. She did not make much money (about 9% with a hold time of just"
"over a month), but she gained experience and a few pennies to put in the bank."

"• Use the identification guidelines to correctly select a broadening bot-"

"out—Table 1.2."
"• If you see a busted pattern, trade it—Table 1.2."
"• BBs in bull markets with upward breakouts have the lowest failure"

"• Performance usually suffers after a throwback or pullback. Search for"
"overhead resistance (upward breakouts) or underlying support (down-"
"ward breakouts) before trading—Table 1.4."
"• Use partial rises or declines to enter a trade sooner with little increase"
"in risk—Table 1.4."
"• BBs in a bear market bottom quicker than BBs in a bull market, so"
"short BBs in a bear market for the quickest turnover (but the payoff will"
"be lower, on average)—Table 1.5."
"• Watch for the price trend to change 5 to 6 weeks after the breakout—"
"Table 1.5."
"• Select tall or narrow patterns—Table 1.6."
"• BBs both tall and narrow outperform the other combinations. Avoid"
"short and wide ones—Table 1.6."
"• Select BBs with a falling volume trend for upward breakouts. A rising"
"volume trend works better for downward breakouts—Table 1.7."
"• Pick patterns with a random volume shape (flat, rising or falling)—"

"around and pulled back to the base of the formation. Although not shown in"
"Figure 2.2, the stock continued moving up until it began forming another"
"ascending broadening formation in late October with a base at 16.50."
"The ascending broadening formation represents the desire of investors"
"and traders to own the stock at a fixed price, in this case about 12.25. Their"
"buying enthusiasm pushes prices higher until mounting selling pressure causes"
"a halt to the rise and sends the stock tumbling. With each attempt, fewer peo-"
"ple are left willing to sell their shares until they receive an even higher price,"
"so a broadening range of prices appears at the top. Eventually, the buying"
"enthusiasm at the base of the formation collapses and removes the support for"
"the stock. When that happens, the stock punches through the support level and"
"declines. It continues moving down until reaching a point where other"
"investors perceive significant value and buy the stock."

"Identification Guidelines"
"What are the characteristics of an ascending broadening formation? To answer"
"the question, peruse the selection guidelines outlined in Table 2.1. While con-"
"sidering the table, look at Figure 2.3, an ascending broadening formation on a"
"weekly scale."
"Shape. The overall shape of the formation looks like a megaphone with"
"one side horizontal."
"Horizontal bottom support line. The bottom of the formation follows"
"a horizontal trend line, while an up-sloping trend line bounds the top side."
"Up-sloping top trend line. The top trend line touches at least two"
"minor highs. The horizontal trend line also shows two minor low touches as"
"prices descend to the trend line. The various touch points help define the"
"boundary of the formation."
"Volume. The volume trend is usually upward and U shaped, especially in"
"the last third of the pattern. In Figure 2.3, you can see the U shape from Feb-"
"ruary 1992 to the September 1992 peak, and then rounding down again before"
"heading up to the peak in March 1993."
"Premature breakouts. I define premature breakouts to be prices that"
"close outside the formation boundary but return before the formation ends."

"Measure rule. The measure rule predicts a target price. Compute the"
"height, the difference between the highest high and the horizontal trend line"
"in the formation. For upward breakouts, add the height to the highest high in"
"the pattern. For downward breakouts, subtract this value from the value of the"
"horizontal trend line. The result is the target price. The target should serve as"
"the minimum price move to expect, but with ascending broadening formations,"
"prices usually miss the target. Bull market accuracy ranges from 68% (up break-"
"outs) to 32% (down breakouts). Bear markets targets are correct 43% (up"
"breakouts) and 51% (down breakouts) of the time."
"For a more conservative approach, try calculating the formation height and"
"dividing by 2, and then applying the difference to the pattern’s high or low price."
"Figure 2.5 makes the measure rule clear. The height of the formation is"
"the difference between the highest high (34.13) and the trend-line price"
"(29.25), or 4.88. Subtract the result from the trend-line price, giving a target"
"price of 24.37. The nearer target in the figure uses half the formation height,"
"or 2.44, to give a price target of 26.81."
"Partial rise or decline. A partial rise or decline can be difficult to trade"
"because prices often pause partway across the chart pattern on their way to the"
"opposite side. This pause looks like a partial rise or decline. Wait before buy-"
"ing to be sure that prices are unlikely to continue in the original direction. Try"
"buying when prices close beyond the halfway point between the minor"
"low/high and the trend line."
"For example, if the top trend line is at 20 and prices have declined from"
"there to 14 then started back up in what you suspect is a partial decline, buy"
"when the price closes above 17 (that is half the distance between 20 and 14). You"
"might use Fibonacci retracements of 38%, 50%, or 62% as buying locations. If"
"prices turn at those retracement levels, then consider opening a position."

"Why do these chart patterns form? Look at Figure 3.3. During 1993, the"
"stock entered the first formation in early April and moved higher on moderate"
"volume until it reached about 35. There, investors selling the stock matched"
"buyers eager to own the security and the rise stalled. It traveled sideways until"
"May 10 when it moved below the prior minor low. As the stock approached the"
"31 level, it entered a support zone set up by the retracement in mid-March."
"The decline stalled and moved sideways for several days. Due to the support"
"level, many investors believed that the decline was at an end and the stock"
"would move higher. It did. As volume climbed, the price gapped upward and"
"quickly soared back to the old high."
"The stock ran into selling pressure from institutions and others trying to"
"sell blocks of shares at a fixed price. The available supply halted the advance."
"Prices hung on for a few days, moved a bit lower, and paused before beginning"
"a rapid decline to a new minor low."
"As volume climbed, the stock declined until it touched the lower trend"
"line, a region of support. Suspecting an oversold stock, investors bought and"
"forced it higher again. When the stock reached the old high, there were fewer"
"shares available for purchase. Apparently, those investors and institutions who"
"were trying to get 35 a share for their stock sold most of their shares in the pre-"
"ceding months. Soaking up the available supply, the stock gapped upward and"
"closed above the old high. An upward breakout was at hand."
"The stock moved higher but soon formed another descending broaden-"
"ing formation. This one was compact and tight but had bearish implications."

"Shape                         Looks like a megaphone, tilted down, with the top of the"
"formation horizontal and bounded on the bottom by a"
"down-sloping trend line."
"Horizontal top resistance     A horizontal line of resistance joins the tops as a trend"
"line                        line. Must have at least two distinct touches (minor"
"highs) before drawing a trend line."
"Down-sloping trend line       The expanding price series is bounded on the bottom by"

"Volume                        Upward trend with a domed shape."

"genuine breakout."
"Breakout                      Prices can break out in either direction, usually"
"accompanied by a rise in volume that soon tapers off."
"Partial rise or decline       For an established formation, when prices climb toward"
"the top trend line or decline toward the lower one but fail"
"to touch it, prices often reverse direction and break out of"

"Horizontal top resistance line. When two minor highs achieve the"
"same, or nearly the same, price level, you can draw a horizontal trend line con-"
"necting them."
"Down-sloping trend line. The same applies to the down-sloping trend"
"line: It requires at least two distinct touches before drawing the trend line."
"There is usually ample time to recognize a broadening formation, and many"
"times there are more than two touches of each trend line."
"Volume. Volume tends to rise over the length of the chart pattern, some-"
"times following the price action. The shape of the pattern looks like a dome"
"more often than a U-shaped pit or a random pattern."
"Premature breakouts. Premature breakouts are rare, so if price closes"
"above the top trend line or below the bottom trend line, consider it a gen-"
"uine breakout."
"Breakout. A breakout occurs when price closes outside (above or below)"
"the trend-line boundaries. The breakout can occur in any direction, but the pat-"
"tern acts as a reversal of the prevailing price trend slightly more often than not."
"Partial rise or decline. A partial rise, as shown in Figure 3.3, or a partial"
"decline is often a clue to the ultimate breakout direction. When prices curl"
"around on a partial rise or decline and return to the trend line, they usually"
"break out immediately (that is, without crossing the formation again)."

"Support and resistance. The trend lines, when projected into the future,"
"can sometimes act as areas of support or resistance, depending on which side"
"prices are approaching (Figures 3.1, 3.3, and 3.6 show examples). Sometimes"
"the support or resistance level is active for months or even years at a time."
""

"Focus on Failures"
"Since descending broadening formations can break out in either direction, I"
"show both views of failed breakouts. The first one, Figure 3.4, is characterized"
"by the telltale partial decline in late November. From there, the stock climbs"
"and eventually pierces the top trend line, as predicted. Once price closes above"
"the trend line, you would expect it to throw back to the formation top then"
"continue higher or simply move upward. In this situation, prices stall at 45 and"
"return to the formation proper—a classic throwback. Unfortunately, instead of"
"rebounding and heading higher like a typical throwback, the stock continues"
"down. It does more work inside the formation before shooting out the other"
"side in a straight-line run."
"Had you purchased after the upward breakout, you would have seen the"
"stock decline from a purchase point of about 44.50 to a low of 36.88. Even a"
"stop at the lowest point of the formation would have gotten you out at 39, still"

"If the stock breaks out downward, the measure rule computation is nearly"

"price of 37.50. Be aware that upward breakouts in a bull market are more likely"
"to reach their targets (63%) than other combinations. Refer to the Results"
"Snapshot, “Percentage meeting price target” for the statistics."
"Wait for confirmation. You might think that price will break out"
"upward in a rising price trend, but it does not a suprising percentage of the"
"time. Thus, you should wait for confirmation—price to close outside the"
"trend-line boundary—before trading the stock."

"Measure rule             Compute the formation height by taking the difference"
"between the horizontal top and the lowest low in the"
"formation. For upward breakouts, add the result to the value"
"of the horizontal trend line. For downward breakouts,"
"subtract the value from the lowest low. The result is the"
"expected target price."
"Wait for confirmation     It is unclear which way prices will break out, so it is best to"
"wait for prices to close outside the trend lines. Once they do,"
"expect prices to continue moving in the direction of the"
"breakout. Place your trades accordingly."
"Stops                     Once a breakout occurs, consider the opposite side of the"
"formation as the stop-loss point. However, in many cases you"
"will want something closer to your purchase price, so look for"
"nearer support or resistance zones. Once the stock moves"
"substantially, advance the stop to the break-even point or"
"higher."
"Intraformation            For aggressive traders, consider placing a trade as prices"
"trading                 reverse course at the trend line. Go long at the bottom and"
"short at the top, but be sure to use stops to protect against"
"an adverse breakout."

"Stops. Once you know the target price, you can make a profit and loss"
"assessment of the trade. What is the likely downward move compared with the"
"target price? Does the potential profit justify the risk of the trade? For Figure"
"3.6, there is support in the 46 to 47 area. Examining the peaks and valleys of"
"the prior price action determines support and resistance levels. In March 1995"
"(not shown in the figure), there is an area of congestion bounded by a sym-"
"metrical triangle with an apex at about 46. Additional resistance appears in July"
"and October, as shown. Together, the 46 to 47 area makes a good location for"
"a stop-loss order."
"Let us say the stop is 45.75, just below the bottom of the support area. If"
"the trade happens at 50.50, which is the close the day after the upward break-"
"out, that gives a potential loss of less than 10%. With a target price of 55.50,"
"or 10% upside, the win/loss ratio is an unexciting one to one. In such a situa-"
"tion, you could either tighten your stop by moving it higher (and risk getting"
"taken out by normal price action) or look elsewhere for a more profitable trade."
"Remember there is no rule that says you have to place a trade."

"for all they are worth. When he noticed what he thought was either a descend-"
"ing broadening wedge or a right-angled descending broadening formation, he"
"bought the stock. His order, placed at point C in Figure 3.6 (46.38), was just"
"after the stock bounced off the lower trend line."
"He monitored it closely and watched the stock move up the very next day,"
"then ease lower. After a few days, Ralph saw a symmetrical triangle form and"
"he became worried. Those formations, he reasoned, usually follow the trend"
"and the trend was downward. When the stock moved below the lower triangle"
"trend line, Ralph sold the stock and received a fill at 46.50."

"When he erased the lines from his computer screen and looked at the fresh"
"price chart, he knew he had made the right decision because a partial rise, such as"
"where the triangle formed, usually portends an immediate downward breakout."
"Sure enough, the following day prices dropped even further, tagging the"

"Trading Tactics"
"Table 4.8 outlines trading tactics for broadening top formations."
"Measure rule. The first thing to consider about trading tactics is the"
"measure rule. The measure rule predicts the price to which the stock will"
"move. For many formations, one simply computes the height of the formation"
"and adds the result to the breakout price. Broadening formations are not much"
"different. Consider Figure 4.5. The height of the formation is the difference"
"between the highest high (12.13) and the lowest low (10), or 2.13. For upward"
"breakouts, add the height to the highest high in the chart pattern giving a min-"
"imum price move of 14.26, as shown in the figure."
"How do you make use of the measure rules? Imagine that you are con-"
"sidering purchasing the stock. Since it is never clear which way a broadening"
"formation will ultimately break out, it is difficult to pick a good long-term"
"entry point. The easiest way to invest using the formation is to buy just after"
"the stock turns at the bottom trend line."
"Go long at the low. Since a broadening formation requires two points"
"along the top trend line and two along the bottom before the formation appears,"
"point A in Figure 4.5 shows one likely investment location. Before placing the"
"                                                                                 Trading Tactics    77"

"buy order, compute the target price using the measure rule. The target price"
"will help you determine if the potential gain is worth the risk. In the example"
"shown in Figure 4.5, the purchase price is about 10.38 and the target price is"
"14.25, a 37% move. The stop loss should be 9.85, for a potential loss of 5%,"
"which gives a reward-to-risk ratio of 7 to 1, more than enough to risk a trade."
"On an upward breakout, prices reach the target about 60% of the time."
"Thus, do not depend on prices reaching the target."
"Long stop. Buy the stock as soon after it touches the lower trend line and"
"moves higher. Place a stop-loss order 0.15 below the lowest low (0.15 below"
"point A). Should prices drop, your position will likely be sold before a large"
"loss occurs."
"If the stock fails to break out upward, perhaps you can join the ride to the"
"upper trend line. Buy when prices turn upward at the lower trend line, then be"
"ready to sell once prices reach the old high. Prices may pause for a bit before"
"moving higher and tagging the top trend line or they may reverse at this point."
"Make sure your stops have been raised to protect your profits."
"What about the measure rule for downward breakouts? Again, the for-"
"mation height is 2.13. Subtract 2.13 from the lowest low (10) to arrive at the"
"target price of 7.87. If prices break out downward, they should reach 7.87."
"However, the reliability of the target price for downward breakouts is just 35%"
"—not very reassuring."
"Short tips. For short positions in broadening tops, open the short after"
"the price touches point B and begins heading down. Place a stop 0.15 above the"
"highest high (12.28 in this case) to limit your losses. Lower your stop to the"
"next minor high or apex of the broadening top (either 11.88 or 11.13 in this"
"case) once the stock nears point A. Sometimes the stock will not make it down"
"to the trend line before beginning to move up. At other times, there is a"
"lengthy pause before prices turn around or continue down. A lower stop-loss"
"point helps you achieve at least some measure of profit."
"Partial decline. The last trading tactic is to look out for partial rises or"
"declines, which occur when prices begin to cross the formation but do not"
"come close to the opposite side. Instead, prices reverse course and break out"
"soon after. When you see a partial rise or decline, place a trade once the stock"
"reverses course. If a breakout happens, then consider adding to your position."

"everything worked as expected, that would give her a return of over 35%. After"
"she placed the trade, she sat back and waited but kept an eye on the price"
"action. When prices paused at the high of the formation, she wondered if the"
"trend was going to reverse. She considered taking her profits and running but"
"decided against it. After a few days, she recognized a flag formation and hoped"
"that it represented a half-staff move (the flag being a halfway point in the"
"upward move). If that were true, she could expect a climb to 13.25 (that is the"
"distance from the top of the flag (12.13) to the start of the move at 10 projected"
"upward using the lowest low in the flag at 11.13)."
"A few days later, the stock not only fulfilled the measure rule for the flag"
"formation, but for the broadening top as well. Did Sandra sell? No. Since the"
"stock was moving up, she decided to let her profits ride. However, she did raise"
"her stop to 11.85, or 0.15 below the formation high. She viewed this point as a"
"support zone and hoped that should the stock retreat to that level, it would"

"The Results Snapshot shows statistics for the ascending broadening wedge"
"(ABW). Since the pattern is so rare in a bear market, many of the remarks in"
"this chapter concern bull markets only. The break-even failure rate is probably"
"higher than the 2% shown in a bull market due to the low sample count. For"
"downward breakouts, the break-even failure rate is probably accurate at 11%."
"The 38% average rise is above the 36% rise for other bullish chart patterns."
"If you can tell when the trend changes, you can make a lot of money after"
"a downward breakout. For example, after the stock reaches the ultimate low,"
"prices rise an average of 49%. Thus, even if you miss the turn, there are still"
"profits waiting if you trade the pattern properly."
"ABWs have a few surprises, most of which we have seen before. A partial"
"rise comes at the end of the pattern, and it accurately predicts a downward"
"breakout about 75% of the time. More about that and the other surprises in the"
"Statistics section."

"Tour"
"What does an ascending broadening wedge look like? Consider the chart pat-"
"tern in Figure 5.1. The first thing you notice is the two sloping trend lines; the"
"top one has a slightly steeper slope than the bottom one. Together, the two"
"trend lines spread out over time but both slope upward. Once prices pierce the"
"bottom trend line, they drop rapidly. The chart looks like a pie-shaped wedge"
"that slopes uphill. That is why it is called an ascending broadening wedge. The"
"price action alternates and is contained by two nonparallel trend lines."
"Figure 5.2 shows a better example of a broadening wedge, with two up-"
"sloping trend lines where the slope of the top trend line is much steeper than"
"the bottom one."

"Figures 5.1 and 5.2 both show a similar situation. The formation appears"
"at the end of a rising price trend and signals a reversal. Although a reversal is"
"not always the case, nor is the formation required to be at the end of a rising"
"price trend, both situations occur more often than not."
"Figure 5.2 also shows an interesting pattern that is key in identifying the"
"start of a new price trend: the partial rise. After touching the lower trend line,"
"prices again move up but fail to touch the higher trend line. As prices descend,"
"they pierce the lower trend line and continue moving down. The chart also"
"shows a similar situation that occurs earlier in the price pattern, around the"
"start of the new year: That rising price trend fails to touch the upper trend line."
"Prices return to the lower trend line, then rebound and zoom up again to"
"touch the higher trend line. The partial rise fails to predict a change in trend."
"We explore partial rises later."
"Why does a broadening wedge form? Pretend for a moment that you are"
"the head of an investment conglomerate that has big bucks to spend and wants"
"to buy shares in another company. When the price is low, you instruct your"
"trading department to begin buying. The sudden buying demand forces the"
"price to climb even though the trading department spreads its orders over sev-"
"eral days and through several brokers. The trading department tries to keep its"
"buying quiet, but the word gets out that you are in the market. The momen-"
"tum players jump on your coattails and ride the stock upward by buying too."
"This sends the stock higher than you expected, so your trading department"
"stops buying for the moment."
"Value investors, sensing an overbought situation developing, are willing"
"to sell their shares at the higher price. Soon the stock is moving down again."
"But before it can reach its old low, the buy-the-dip crowd jumps in and halts"
"the decline. Your trading department, seeing a higher low form, jumps back in"
"and buys while the price is still reasonable. Some new value investors also"
"decide the stock is worthy of a flyer and add to the buying pressure. The com-"
"pany itself gets into the act and buys shares authorized by the board of direc-"
"tors as a share-buyback program announced long ago. The buyback program"
"is nearing the expiration date and the company feels it is the right time to buy"
"to complete their promise to shareholders."
"The stock makes a new high. When it climbs high enough, the selling"
"pressure overwhelms the buying demand and sends the shares lower, but the"
"price will not drop far—not with everyone trying to buy at a good price. What"
"you have then are much higher highs from the unbridled buying enthusiasm"
"and higher, but more sane, lows as your conglomerate and the company itself"
"try to buy near a fixed low price. You never quite succeed and pay higher and"
"higher prices as the minor lows move up."
"Soon, however, the stock is too pricey even for your tastes. You may even"
"decide it is time to sell some, or all, of your holdings. Meanwhile, the momen-"
"tum players send the stock coasting higher, but this time the price does not"
"come close to the upper trend line."

"Everyone has an ear to the ground listening, trying to figure out what all the"
"buying enthusiasm is about. In the distance, a rumble sounds. The same-store"
"sales numbers are going to be lower this quarter, the shorts say. This time the"
"rumor finds sympathetic ears. The rumble heard earlier is the stampede of the"
"smart money running for the exits. The price drops quickly. It may hover for a bit"
"around support zones while novice investors, who have not gotten the word, buy"

"abates and the stock crashes through the lower trend line and heads down further."

"Identification Guidelines"
"There are a number of identification guidelines, outlined in Table 5.1, that"
"make this formation unique. As I discuss the different guidelines, consider the"
"ascending broadening wedge depicted in Figure 5.3. This formation is differ-"
"ent from Figures 5.1 and 5.2 in that it is born from a region of consolidation."
"From the beginning of the study in July 1991, prices move generally horizon-"
"tally and do not fall much below the 15.38 level (Figure 5.3 shows only a por-"
"tion of the prior price action)."
"The situation changes just before the new year. Prices start moving up on"
"December 23. They reach a new high in mid-January but soon move down. At"
"that point, two tentative trend lines connect the highs and lows. Although it is"
"too early to form a definitive conclusion, a broadening wedge appears to be"
"taking shape. After prices move up and touch the upper trend line then pull"

"Characteristic            Discussion"
"Shape                     Looks like a megaphone, tilted up, with price action that"
"outlines two up-sloping trend lines."
"Trend lines               The top trend line has a steeper upward slope than the lower"
"one and neither is horizontal."
"Touches                   There should be at least three distinct touches (or near"
"touches) of the trend lines on each side. This helps assure"
"proper identification and performance of the formation."
"Volume                    Irregular with a slight tendency to rise over the length of the"
"formation."
"Premature breakouts       Very rare. A close below the lower trend line is usually a"
"genuine breakout."
"Breakout                  The breakout direction is downward the vast majority of"
"times, but an upward breakout is not unheard of."
"Partial rise              Prices touch the lower trend line, climb toward the top trend"
"line, but fail to touch it. Prices reverse direction and break out"
"downward from the formation."

"in about 5% of the formations."

"back to the lower one again, the broadening wedge formation is clearly visible."
"At the start of March, prices move higher but quickly stall, turn around, and"
"pierce the lower trend line. The partial rise and trend-line penetration suggest"
"a trend change is at hand."
"It is a false breakout. Prices travel higher for 3 days in a tight, narrow pattern"
"then zoom upward and touch the upper trend line. The bottom trend line has to"
"be redrawn to accommodate the slight decline below the old trend line. Clearly,"
"prices have more work to do before declining below the lower trend line."
"A month later, prices return to the lower trend line and move higher for"
"a few days. However, the rise stalls and prices pierce the lower trend line. Like"
"a replay of the price action a month earlier, prices pull back to the trend line"
"and start moving higher. However, this rise falters on low volume and prices"
"quickly return to the lower trend line. When prices gap down on April 16, the"
"genuine breakout occurs. In rapid fashion, prices plummet to below 12.75,"
"nearly a 50% decline from the high."
"Shape and trend lines. Looking back at Figures 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, there"
"are several characteristics that ascending broadening wedges have in common."
"The overall shape appears as a megaphone, but this megaphone tilts upward:"
"both trend lines slope higher. The upper trend line has a higher slope than the"

""
"three-touch minimum helps remove consideration given to normal price"
"action and helps identify reliable chart patterns."
"Volume. The volume pattern is irregular but generally rises as prices move"
"up and recedes as prices decline. Although it is not clear from the charts, volume"
"tends to rise over time. However, this tendency is slight when considering all"
"ascending broadening wedges and is not a mandatory selection guideline."
"Breakouts. Figure 5.3 shows an exceptional premature breakout. Usu-"
"ally, prices follow the lower trend line and do not penetrate it until very near"
"the breakout. When prices do break out, the price action can be messy, as"
"shown in the figure. Sometimes price runs straight through the lower trend"
"line without pausing, and sometimes it weaves around the trend line before"
"finally continuing down. In either case, the breakout is usually downward."
"Partial rise. The partial rise, already mentioned, occurs in half of the"
"ascending broadening wedges. Since it usually occurs just before a breakout, it"
"is an important trend change indicator. In a partial rise, prices start moving up,"
"after having touched the lower trend line, then stop before touching (or com-"
"ing close to) the upper one. Prices return to the lower trend line and usually"
"head lower, staging a genuine breakout. Note that a partial rise must begin"
"from the lower trend line, not as an upward retrace from the top trend line."

"You can see how the failure rates start comparatively small then shoot up"
"as the maximum price rise or decline increases. Ignoring the small sample"
"counts for bear markets, the lowest failure rates occur in patterns with an"
"upward breakout in a bull market. Half the patterns fail to rise more than"
"about 27% under those conditions (bull/up)."
"Table 5.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics."
"Formation end to breakout. It takes between 12 and 30 days before"
"price closes outside the trend-line boundary. That is an average, so your results"
"will vary. Upward breakouts take longer than downward ones to pierce the"
"trend line. This observation makes sense because the upper trend line has a"
"steeper slope and prices are rising along with the trend line. For downward"
"breakouts, the trend line slopes up but prices are falling."
"Yearly position. Where in the yearly price range do ABWs occur? The"
"breakout usually happens near the yearly high except in a bear market with a"
"downward breakout, which shows more breakouts in the middle of the yearly"
"range."
"Yearly position, performance. Mapping performance onto the yearly"
"price range, we find that the middle of the yearly price range performs better"
"than the other ranges. The exception is for ABWs with downward breakouts in"
"a bull market, but the sample size is small."
"Throwbacks and pullbacks. Throwbacks and pullbacks occur about half"
"the time, and it takes the stock between 9 and 13 days to return to the break-"
"out price. However, when throwbacks and pullbacks occur, performance suf-"
"fers, as Table 5.4 shows (except for ABWs in a bear market with upward"
"breakouts)."
"Gaps. Most of the time, when a breakout day gap occurs, performance"
"improves. The exception: the 51% rise in a bull market may come down with"
"additional samples."
"Partial rises and declines. Consider the bull market, down breakout"
"column that has a good sample size. A partial rise correctly anticipated the"
"downward breakout 74% of the time. When a partial rise occurs, prices drop"
"17% after the breakout, on average, meeting the average decline for ABWs."
"Intraformation partial rises and declines. Intraformation partial rises"
"and declines—those that occur within the pattern but with prices that continue"
"crossing the pattern—occur, at most, 17% of the time. Thus, you should feel"
"safe trading a partial rise or decline. They get you into the trade before the"
"breakout and correctly predict the breakout direction (usually). Consult the"
"Glossary if you are unfamiliar with a partial rise or decline."
"Table 5.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or"
"low. Since the bear market samples are few, look at the two bull market rows."
"Over half (52%) of upward breakouts do not reach the ultimate high before 70"
"days. Half of all downward breakouts will bottom in the first month (20 + 10 +"

"Wait for confirmation. This formation has a good track record of down-"
"ward breakouts. However, 27% of the time prices break out upward. If you"
"wait for a breakout before investing, you substantially increase your chances of"
"a profitable trade. Once prices decline below the lower trend line, sell the stock"
"short. Be prepared to cover the short as prices near the target, especially if the"
"price approaches an area of support."
"In Figure 5.5, the lowest formation low on the left is also a support point."

"tance. During March, prices try to rebound but turn away near the 36 level."
"Partial rise. An exception to the wait for breakout-confirmation rule is if"
"a partial rise occurs. Looking again at Figure 5.5, you might conclude that"
"there is a partial rise in the right formation. Wrong. I define a partial rise as"
"when prices touch the lower trend line, move up, then return to the lower"
"trend line. The figure shows prices starting from the top trend line, not the"
"lower one. Figure 5.2 shows a properly identified partial rise."
"If you detect a partial rise, consider shorting the stock. In 74% to 78% of"

"before the breakout, your profits should be larger. When the stock declines to"

"Sample Trade"
"Curtis works the night shift at a large bakery near his home. Working at night"
"frees the daylight hours for other activities, such as sleep. Occasionally, he"
"spots a situation such as that shown in Figure 5.5, one that makes the morning"
"sun seem even brighter."
"Each day before he hit the sack, he plotted the stock and watched with"
"amusement as the first broadening wedge formed. When the second one"
"appeared, he wiped the sleep from his eyes and took notice. It was not so much"
"the broadening wedge that excited him; it was the wedge coupled with the dou-"
"ble top. Together, they spelled an especially bearish situation, one that he was"
"willing to shell out his hard earned money to trade."
"The day after the stock closed below the lower trend line, Curtis sold the"
"stock short and received a fill at 39.50. He used the double top measure rule to"
"estimate his target price. With a top at 45.75 and a valley low of 36.25, the target"
"turned out to be 26.75 (that is 45.75–36.25 subtracted from 36.25). He decided to"
"place an order to cover the short at 27.13, just above the whole number and just"
"above where everyone else was likely to place theirs. Then he went to bed."
"Each day, before he closed the curtains to get some sleep, he would check"
"on his stock. To him, it was pleasing to see the stock begin moving down"
"immediately and sailing below the nearest broadening wedge target price"
"(38.88). He lost some sleep worrying about the upward retrace in March, and"

"Down-sloping              Both trend lines slope downward, with the lower trend line having"

"Volume                    Usually rises over the length of the formation. However, the volume"
"pattern is not a prerequisite."
"Breakout                  Can be in any direction but 55% of the time, price breaks out"
"opposite the prevailing price trend."
"Partial decline           For a partial decline, prices must touch the top trend line and move"
"down, turn around, then head higher without coming close to the"
"lower trend line. An upward breakout usually follows a partial decline."

"BARR top flipped upside down, so I call it a BARR bottom. I guess a more"

"Why do BARR bottoms occur? Like the top version, the BARR bottom"
"is a study of momentum. Consider the chart shown in Figure 7.1 on a weekly"
"scale. Since late 1991, the stock was moving sideways—a trading range between"
"6.50 and 11. However, that changed during the last week of October 1993,"
"when the stock moved up and closed higher than the prior week. At first, this"
"did not seem unusual since many weeks close higher than the prior week, but"
"this one was different. It initiated a long climb to the highs of early January. On"
"the highest volume that the stock had seen in years, the stock hit a new high of"
"14.38 during the week of January 14, 1994. Volume began tapering off, although"
"it was still high, and prices tagged a much smaller peak during the week of"
"March 25, at 14. The two minor highs, one in mid-January and another in late"
"March, formed the basis of a down-sloping trend line."
"As weekly volume trended lower, so did enthusiasm for the stock. Eventu-"
"ally, bullish sentiment could not sustain the high price and the stock collapsed."
"As it headed down, volume continued to taper off. The upward momentum"
"experienced during the rise to the highs in January was now working against the"
"stock. Over the course of a year, the stock gave back all its gains and, by mid-"
"February 1995, it started sinking to new lows."
"High volume a month later was key as it signaled a turning point. A week"
"later, again on high volume, the stock closed higher by over 10%. The upward"
"move had begun but soon stalled out. The stock moved sideways for another 2"

"Identification Characteristics"
""
"Characteristic         Discussion"
"Arithmetic scale       Use the arithmetic chart, not a semilogarithmic one."
"Frying pan shape       The formation looks like a frying pan with the handle on the"
"left sloping downward to the pan. After a deepening decline"
"that takes prices into the pan base, prices level out and"
"eventually soar out the right side."
"Down-sloping           The handle forms a down-sloping trend line that approximates"
"top trend line,       0–45 degrees (but this varies with scaling). The handle portion"
"lead-in height        of the formation is called the lead-in as it leads in to the bump"
"phase. The lead-in height measures from the trend line drawn"
"across the highs to the low (not necessarily the lowest low) of"
"the formation. Select the widest distance from the trend line to"
"the low, measured vertically, in the first quarter of the"
"formation. The duration of the lead-in should be at least a"
"month, but varies depending on the situation."
"Bump phase             The bump is analogous to the frying pan base. The down-"
"sloping trend line deepens to 60 degrees or more. Prices drop"
"rapidly then level out and turn around, usually forming a"
"rounded turn. After the turn, prices move up and sometimes"
"pause at the 30-degree trend line before moving higher. The"
"bump height, as measured from the trend line to the lowest"
"low, should be at least twice the lead-in height. Strict"
"adherence to this rule is not required, but it serves as a good"
"general guideline."
"Uphill run             Once prices lift out of the bump phase, they begin an uphill"
"run that carries prices higher."
"Volume                 Volume is typically high during the three critical parts of the"
"formation: formation start, bump start, and upward breakout."
"However, high volume is not a prerequisite."
""
""
""
""
"Arithmetic scale. Use the arithmetic scale, not a semilogarithmic one,"
"because the semilog scale distorts vertical distances."
"Frying pan shape. Overall, the formation appears as a frying pan. The"
"handle, or lead-in phase, forms a trend line that slopes downward at an angle"
"of about 30 degrees to 45 degrees, more or less. Draw the trend line along the"
"daily high prices as the line signals a buying opportunity once pierced."
"Unlike BARR tops, sometimes horizontal trend lines in the lead-in phase"
"contain valid BARR bottoms. Such situations are rare, though, and should be"
"avoided. The trend lines in this study are higher on the left and slope down-"
"ward—these give the best performance."

"Focus on Failures"
"Figure 7.3 shows what a BARR bottom failure looks like. The stock starts its"
"ascent in June 1994 when it hits a low of 24.50 (not shown). Although the rise"
"is not a straight-line path, prices reach a new high a year later (the highest peak"
"on the left). Then it is downhill from there. The decline is quite orderly with"
"peaks that follow the trend line down. During early September, however,"
"prices drop rapidly on high volume as the bump forms. Prices quickly reach a"
"low of 33.63 before rebounding. Having sliced through the trend line and"
"moving just a bit higher, prices throw back and follow the trend line lower."
"Prices following a trend line lower are not unusual, but what is unusual is that"
"prices do not continue their climb. Instead, they drop off the end of the trend"
"line and plummet. By late June, they slip to under $20 a share, less than half"
"what they were at the high."
"Why did the BARR fail? This formation is not a perfect example of a"
"BARR bottom, but few formations are. In this case, the bump height is less"
"than twice the lead-in height. However, the height depends on how the trend"
"line is drawn. Drawing a trend line beginning from the peak at point A, the"
"bump to lead-in height is about 2 to 1. The new trend line also touches the"
"peak at B. So, if you wait for prices to move above the new trend line before"

"above the trend line, buy the stock."
"Sell at old high. I have discussed how often a stock showing a BARR bot-"
"tom stops near the old high (which is the start of the formation). Place a sell"
"order near the price level of the old high. That will keep your profits intact"
"should the stock then turn down. If you are reluctant to sell your holdings, why"
"not sell half when the stock reaches the old high, then see what happens?"
"Stops. As always, place a stop-loss order 0.15 below the nearest support"

"Sample Trade"
"Perhaps the most interesting way to illustrate trading tactics is by example."
"John is new to investing, and he did not take the time to learn thoroughly"
"about BARR bottoms. As he flipped through his stock charts one day, he"
"noticed an intriguing situation developing in the stock depicted in Figure 7.6."
"During August, the stock peaked, declined a bit, then formed a second minor"
"high. As the stock declined from the second high, John drew a tentative trend"
"line down connecting them. Soon, he noticed that the stock was descending in"
"a sort of channel. He drew a second trend line, parallel to the first, that con-"
"nected the lows."
"However, the stock soon pierced through the second trend line and"
"moved lower. When it declined even further, John thought he recognized a"
"BARR bottom forming. He drew a third trend line, parallel to the other two"
"and lead-in height apart."
"As the stock dipped below the lowest trend line, he believed that the"
"decline was at an end. So, the following day he pulled the trigger and bought"
"100 shares at 18.25. He was pleased to acquire the stock a bit below the clos-"
"ing price for the day."
"For the next week, the stock shot upward and pierced the second trend"
"line. John was brimming with enthusiasm and believed that picking stocks was"
"an easy game, as he put it. As the stock moved into a consolidation period, John"
"showed no concern. Flat periods of trading often follow quick rises."

"When the stock neared the top trend line, John calculated the target"

"would likely break out at about 21.25, so this gave him a target price of 23.25,"

"retraces 38% to 62% of its gains. He grabbed his calculator and computed the"
"retrace value."
"The stock reached a high of 21.43 in a straight-line run from the low at"
"18, a rise of about 3.50 points. Now the stock was retracing the gains and had"
"moved down to 18.75, a 78% retrace. Clearly, this was out of the realm of a"
"simple retrace. John suspected that a trend change had occurred, but hoped"
"that the pause he was seeing as it touched the middle trend line would give the"
"stock support and call an end to the decline. For a while, it did. The stock"
"paused for 3 days at the trend line then started moving lower again. It quickly"
"fell below the purchase price and headed down."
"Although John had purchased the stock as a short-term play, he con-"
"vinced himself that he really liked the company and would not mind holding it"
"for the long term. Now, at least, that is what it would take for him to recoup"
"his losses and get out at breakeven."
"The stock moved through the third trend line, heading lower. The easy"
"game was now turning into a disaster. John first considered selling on Decem-"
"ber 11, when the stock reached 12.75, for a 30% loss. He delayed the selling"
"decision by saying that the holding was a long-term one and he should expect"
"to come across such declines in the short term."
"The next day, the stock closed higher, and it gave him renewed hope."
"Indeed, it closed even higher the following day. But the 2-day recovery was an"
"illusion and the stock declined again. As it plunged below 12.75, John threw up"
"his hands and told his broker to dump the dog. He received a fill at 12.25, the"

"had formed. After suffering through the large bump, the stock moved higher"
"until it touched the BARR trend line. Then, the stock followed it lower, unable"
"to pierce the resistance line."
"During the week of March 27, 1992, the stock closed above the trend line"
"for the first time in months. The BARR was complete and a confirmed break-"
"out was occurring. Did John buy the stock? No. For several months, he"
"watched its progress as it moved higher almost week after week. Disgusted, he"

"see that it continued moving higher. It had just reached a high of 50.13, a"
"climb of almost 370%. He grabbed his calculator and realized that his mistake"
"cost him over $3,000."

"closer to the low, saving him precious capital. Next, he did not cut his losses"

"Arithmetic scale          Do not use a semilogarithmic scale; instead us an arithmetic one."
"Rising trend line         A trend line connecting the lows rises steadily: no horizontal or"
"near-horizontal trend lines. The trend line usually rises at about"
"30–45 degrees (although this varies with scaling). Avoid trend"
"lines that are too steep (over 60 degrees): There is not enough"
"room for the bump."
"Lead-in, lead-in height   The lead-in is the section just before prices move up sharply in"
"the bump phase. Lead-in prices should have a range of at least"
"$1 (preferably $2 or more), as measured from the highest high"
"to the trend line, vertically, during the first quarter of the"
"overall formation length. Minimum lead-in length is 1 month"
"with no maximum value."
"Rounded bump              Prices rise up (trend line slope is 45–60 degrees or more) on"
"high volume usually after a favorable event (unexpectedly good"
"earnings, an analyst recommends or upgrades the stock, higher"
"store sales, that sort of thing). Prices eventually round over and"
"decline back to the 30 degree trend line. The bump must be at"
"least twice the lead-in height, measured from highest high to"
"the trend line, vertically."

"Arithmetic scale. Use the arithmetic scale not a semilogarithmic one"
"because the semilog scale distorts vertical distance."
"Rising trend lines. In the figure, a trend line drawn below the lows in the"
"stock extends until it intersects prices as they decline in May. Volume is high"
"at the start of the pattern and the trend is up. That is a key consideration:"
"Prices must be rising. The trend line should be approximately 30 degrees, but"
"the degree of slope depends on the scaling used to view the chart. If the trend"
"line is flat or nearly so, it is not a good BARR candidate. A rising trend line shows"
"investor enthusiasm for the stock. However, the trend line should not be too"
"steep either. Steep trend lines (over 60 degrees or so) do not allow enough"
"room for the bump to complete properly."
"Lead-in, lead-in height. The first part of the formation, called the lead-"
"in phase, leads to the bump phase. The lead-in phase should be at least 1 month"
"long and usually falls in the 2- to 3-month range, but can be considerably"
"longer. Prices oscillate up and down in this phase and have a range of at least $1"
"as measured from the highest high to the trend line. This range, called the lead-"
"in height, is calculated using prices from the first quarter of the formation."
"Figure 8.1, for example, shows that the highest high during the first quar-"

"directly below this date has a value of about 24.25, giving a lead-in height of"
"1.38. The height is important because the minimum bump height and target"
"price, calculated later, use this value. A more accurate approach is to use the"
"largest distance from the trend line to the high, which is not necessarily found"
"between the highest high and the trend line. Use whatever method makes you"
"feel comfortable."
"During the lead-in phase, subdued price action looks as if the stock is"
"gathering strength for the bump phase. Prices do not move very far away from"
"the trend line and usually appear rounded. If you visualize the formation as a"
"mountain range, the lead-in phase represents the foothills."
"Volume during the lead-in phase is high at the start. Often this is due to"
"events that occur just before the formation begins. Volume drops off until the"
"start of the bump, when it suddenly rises. The higher share turnover and"
"expanding enthusiasm for the stock forces prices up. In Figure 8.1, this price"
"rise occurs on February 17 and is accompanied by volume that is the highest in"
"half a year."
"Rounded bump. Prices jump up at the bump start and quickly rise from"
"a low of 26.50 to a high of 34.38 during late March. Volume remains high"
"throughout this period then quickly tapers off as prices round over at the top."
"Many times, the top takes on the appearance of a head-and-shoulders forma-"
"tion or a double or triple top. If you recognize any of these formations on your"
"chart, ignore the BARR top formation and obey the implications of the indi-"
"vidual formations."
"The bump height, as measured from the highest high to the trend line,"
"should be at least twice the lead-in height. In this example, the bump height is"
"8 (that is, 34.38–26.38). This is more than twice the lead-in height of 1.38."
"The reason for the minimum two-to-one ratio is arbitrary. The idea is to"
"make sure that investor enthusiasm and, hence, momentum are getting carried"
"away. An up-sloping trend line that turns into a bump with a higher sloping"
"trend line emphasizes the rising momentum. Sustaining such unbounded"
"enthusiasm for too long is difficult and the stock price eventually declines. In"
"Figure 8.1, that is exactly what happens. Prices round over and start heading"
"down. Sometimes the decline is orderly and sometimes it is choppy. In nearly"
"all cases, prices return to the trend line. Once there, the stock may do several"
"things. Fairly often prices bump up again, and that is called a BARR with a dual"
"bump or a dual BARR. Occasionally, a dual BARR consists of several bumps"
"but the result is still the same. Prices eventually fall below the trend line."
"Downhill run. Sometimes prices slide up along the trend line for a"
"month or so before continuing down. At other times, prices drop straight"
"through the trend line, turn around and climb again, before ultimately drop-"
"ping. In a few rare cases, prices descend from the bump high and never make"
"it back to the trend line before moving higher. These cases commonly appear"

"The cup-with-handle formation was popularized by William J. O’Neil in his"
"book, How to Make Money in Stocks (McGraw-Hill, 1988). He gives a couple of"
"examples such as that shown in Figure 9.1. The stock climbed 295% in about 2"
"months (computed from the right cup lip to the ultimate high). Unfortunately,"
"it does not meet O’Neil’s criteria for a cup-with-handle formation. I discuss my"
"interpretation of his criteria in a moment, but let us first take a closer look at the"
"chart pattern. The stock began rising in early August at a price of about 5.50 and"
"climbed steadily until it bumped up in early December. Volume, incidentally,"
"was very high for the stock at this stage. The stock climbed robustly then"
"rounded over and plunged back through an earlier trend line. It completed a"
"bump-and-run reversal (BARR). During its climb, the stock reached a high of"
"26.88 during late December and a low of 12.38 after the BARR top—a loss of"
"54%. The rise and decline formed the left side of the cup. Over the next 2"
"months, prices meandered upward and pierced the old high during late March."
"The rise to the old high completed the right side of the cup."

"In the first edition of this book, I applied as many of his guidelines as I"
"could and found that fewer than 10% of the patterns I considered valid cups"
"were chosen. Plus, the performance of the selected few was not as good as the"
"cups I found using the Bulkowski guidelines shown in Table 9.1. For more"
"information about the cup with handle pattern, consult O’Neil’s book."
"Here is a brief review of the guidelines I found important."
"Rise before cup is at least 30%. As I was selecting cup-with-handle pat-"
"terns, it became apparent that locating cups during an uptrend was important."
"So I used O’Neil’s minimum rise to the left cup lip of 30%. To measure this,"
"I applied the same method as for finding the trend start (see the Glossary for a"
"definition) and reviewed those that fell short of 30%. If the trend start using"
"the mechanical method was shy (usually by just a few percentage points) of the"
"required 30% but the price trend appeared longer on examination, I accepted"
"the pattern. Just 15 of 471 patterns (3%) were in this category."
"U-shaped cup, handle duration. I removed all V-shaped cups and kept"
"the U-shaped ones. I am not sure about the performance effect of this. Also"
"removed were those cups with handles shorter than 7 days (5 trading days). A"
"cup without a handle is a rounding bottom. I considered the handle length as"
"the distance from the right cup lip to the breakout."
"Cup duration. I used a strict interpretation of O’Neil’s cup duration."
"Removed were short cups (fewer than 7 weeks) and overly long ones (over"
"65 weeks)."
"Handles form in upper half of cup. I used a more lax interpretation of"
"where the handle forms on the cup. In other words, I visually inspected the"
"cups to be sure prices in the handle drifted no lower than halfway down the"
"cup. I removed those drifting lower (include all with downward breakouts)."
"When measuring distance, use an arithmetic chart, not a semilogarith-"
"mic chart."
"Cup lips near same price. Finally, I selected cups with lips (tops) at"
"approximately the same price level. Cups with uneven lips are better classified"
"as scallops. I assign no hard percentages to the difference. Use your own judg-"
"ment and the figures in this chapter as guides."
"Figure 9.2 shows another good example of the cup-with-handle pattern."
"The cup gently rounds over and climbs just beyond the old high then pauses."
"Prices drift down in the handle, along with a down-trending volume pattern"
"before the breakout. Then volume surges and prices move smartly upward."
"Two days after the breakout, prices move marginally lower again and enter"
"the region of the right cup lip. After a brief throwback, prices are soon on"
"their way again. Less than 2 months later, the stock tops out at 15.50 for a"
"rise of 22%."
"If you look on either side of the cup in Figure 9.2 you will find two addi-"
"tional cups (portions of which are shown) that fail. The one on the left breaks"
"out downward and the one on the right fails to continue rising by more than"

"Measure rule. The measure rule predicts the price to which the stock"
"will rise, at a minimum. The traditional method involves determining the"
"height of the formation from lowest low in the cup to the high at the right cup"
"lip. Adding the difference to the high at the right cup lip results in the target"
"price. However, this method only has a 50% success rate (half the formations"
"reach their price targets in a bull market—fewer, 27%, in a bear market). For"
"a better target, compute the cup height and take half of it. Then continue as"
"before. The stock reaches the new, lower-priced target 76% of the time in a"
"bull market; 55% in a bear market. This is still shy of the 80% number I con-"
"sider reliable, but it gives a more accurate indication of the likely price rise."
"Figure 9.6 is an example of the two measure rules in practice. Compute"
"the cup height by taking the difference between the right cup high (point A at"
"19) and the cup low (point B at 10). Add the difference (9) to the right cup lip"
"to get the price target (28). Mid-May sees prices hit the target but plummet the"
"following week."
"A more conservative price target uses half the formation height. This"
"method gives a target of just 23.50, reached during early July. The stock climbs"
"to the nearer target quickly and without the severe declines experienced on the"
"way to the more risky price target."
"Buy inner cup. Figure 9.6 also shows an inner cup. If you are going to"

"cup portion appears rounded and a handle follows the pattern on the right. This"
"particular handle is narrow and tall, retracing (from A to B) a significant portion"
"of the decline from the top of the pattern to the right cup rim (point A). Prices"
"continue dropping, confirming the pattern as a valid one when it closes below"
"point A, the low of the right cup rim. The figure shows price gapping lower on"
"high volume, but do not expect such behavior. Once the icup confirms, prices"
"drop but usually not as steeply as that shown."

"cuss them."
"Upward price trend. The pattern acts as a reversal of the prevailing price"
"trend 57% of the time. Since the breakout is downward, that means prices"
"must enter the pattern from the bottom. In Figure 10.2, price drops into the"
"pattern. Thus, this example acts as a continuation of the downward price trend,"
"not a reversal."
"Rounded cup. I did not check the performance of rounded cups versus"
"V-shaped cups, and I tried to limit my selections to the U shape. I consider Fig-"
"ure 10.2 to have the V-shape (but used it in the study anyway) and the other"
"figures in this chapter to be U-shaped or rounded. You may find it easier to pic-"

"Upward price        Just over half the time, the pattern forms as a price top, meaning that"
"trend             prices enter and exit the pattern from the bottom."
"Rounded cup         Look for a smooth, rounded cup, but accept deviations."
"Cup rims            The starting and ending points of the cup should stop near the same"
"price, usually less than 6% difference."
"Cup handle          Between the right cup rim and the breakout is the handle. It can be"
"any length. The median is 40 days long."
"Cup retrace         Price in the handle must not climb above the top of the pattern but"
"should bounce upward. The three most frequent retrace amounts"
"are, in order, 42%, 35%, and 60%."
"Breakout            Price must close below the right cup rim before the pattern is valid."

"Cup rims. The cup rims are points A and B in Figure 10.2. Few patterns"
"I looked at had the same price across the cup rim. Usually, prices in the bottom"
"of the pattern varied by no more than 6%."
"Cup handle. I define the cup handle as the price pattern from the right"
"cup rim to the breakout (that is, until price closes below the level of the right cup"
"rim). In the figure, the handle is from point B until almost May. The median"
"handle length is 40 days, so that gives you some idea of how long handles are."
"Expect variations."
"Cup retrace. I followed two rules: (1) the handle could not rise above"
"the cup top and (2) there must be at least some rise—a bounce to the stock after"
"the decline from the top of the cup. When prices in the handle bounced up, the"
"most common retrace was 42%. That is, prices climbed 42% of the way to the"
"top of the cup before returning to the breakout. The next two most common"
"retrace amounts were 35% and 60%, respectively. All of these numbers are"
"closing in on their respective Fibonacci retrace values of 50%, 38%, and 62%."
"For example, Figure 10.2 shows the retrace as the distance from B to D"
"compared to the distance from B to C. The distance from B to D is 2.16 (6.90"
"– 4.74). The distance from B to C is 7.70 (or 12.44 – 4.74). The retrace is the"
"ratio of these two values, 28%, or 2.16/7.70. Although it may not look like"
"the retrace is a quarter of the distance to the top, that is because the chart uses a"
"logarithmic scale."

"of failure—an identification failure. The cup appears in an upward price trend,"
"suggesting it may act as a reversal. The cup itself is rounded with rims that are"
"5% apart in price. That is close enough for government work, as the saying"
"goes. The handle retrace measures 46%. The pattern qualifies as an icup with"

"Trading Tactics"

"found that using the handle height applied to the low at the right cup rim worked"
"best. For example, suppose the handle price peaks at 20 and the breakout (the"
"low at the right cup rim) is at 17. Subtract the difference, 3, from the right cup"
"rim, 17, to get the target price of 14. Price reaches the target 47% of the time"

"that price leading to the pattern was drifting down in a bull market. A down-"
"ward price trend was good as you want to trade with the trend, but it would have"
"been better if the pattern appeared in a bear market. The cup looked rounded"
"with rims uneven but not too apart in price. The handle showed a distinct bump"
"up but some distance from the cup. She did not know if this made any difference."
"The handle retrace measured 69%, higher than the Fibonacci retrace of 62%."
"Next she reviewed the “For Best Performance” list to improve her odds of"
"a successful trade. Was a pullback likely? No (good), because there was no price"
"action as far back as late 1992 and little underlying support in the two years"

"Prior price trend. Since we are dealing with diamond bottoms and not"
"tops, the prevailing price trend is downward leading to the diamond."
"The hardest part of identifying any pattern is seeing the shape prices make."
"For diamonds, they are especially difficult to identify. However, they occur"
"many times at price turning points. Thus, look for diamond bottoms at the end"
"of a downward price trend. Rarely, diamonds appear in the middle of the trend"
"and prices continue lower instead of reversing."
"Diamond shape. When prospecting for diamonds look for prices to widen"
"out over time forming higher highs and lower lows. The price pattern should"
"look like a broadening bottom chart pattern. Then, prices narrow, forming lower"
"highs and higher lows. The second half should look like a symmetrical triangle."
"If you draw trend lines around the minor lows and highs, the result should"
"appear diamond shaped. More likely, the diamond’s top or bottom will be"
"pushed to one side, making it appear as though the chart pattern is leaning over."
"Volume trend. Volume usually trends downward over the course of the"
"pattern, but need not. Do not discard a chart pattern simply because volume"
"trends upward instead of downward. In fact, the volume shape most often resem-"

"Focus on Failures"
"I changed the definition of a failure for chart pattern types. I no longer consider"
"a breakout in the adverse direction as a failure. If you want to trade a diamond"
"with an upward breakout and it breaks out downward, you will simply look for"
"another trade. Thus, only 5% failures remain. These are when price breaks out"
"of the pattern, moves in the intended direction, but stops and reverses direction"
"before moving far."
"Figure 11.5 shows an example. Is this a valid diamond? Prices trend down-"
"ward into the pattern, the diamond shape is clear, but volume trends upward"
"(higher on the right than the left). Is the rising volume trend cause for concern?"
"No. Breakout day volume is also low instead of high. Everything looks fine"
"except for volume. If this were my trade, the volume anomalies would not even"
"register. I would be more worried about something else. Do you know what it is?"
"Look at the figure again. See that descending triangle hanging above"
"the diamond like storm clouds? Although you may not recognize the triangle"
"pattern, you should be on the lookout for overhead resistance. That solid block"
"of near horizontal price movement starting in October—where the triangle"
"begins—to December where it ends, would scare me off. The only way I would"
"take this trade would be to short it once prices turned down at the triangle."
"That is essentially what happened. Price broke out upward and the mas-"

"Sample Trade"
"Scott graduated from engineering college and took his first professional job at"
"a growing software company. The job pays well, but he has many school loans"
"and a mountain of dept. He thought of using his paycheck to keep ahead of the"
"bills while depending on the bull market to furnish the luxuries."
"He had his eye on a new stereo system and wanted it for a party he was"
"hosting during the Fourth of July festivities. That did not leave him much time,"
"so he searched for a chart pattern he could trade profitably. He chose the dia-"
"mond bottom shown in Figure 11.6. Scott first noticed the diamond in May, a"
"few days before the breakout. He believed that the price would not decline below"
"69.88, 0.12 below the round number of 70 and at the same level as a couple of"
"price peaks in January."
"Risking just $0.75 with a possible reward of $3.75 gave him a risk to reward"
"ratio of 1:5. If everything worked as planned, he would make a tidy sum, enough"
"to buy the stereo."
"The day after the stock broke out upward, he bought and received a fill at"
"71.75 (near point C in Figure 11.6). That was higher than he liked, but with"
"the strength shown, he was sure the trade would work out. Scott dutifully"
"placed his stop-loss order at 69.88 with his broker. Three days later the stock"
"closed at 75, above the target price. He dropped by the music store just to fon-"
"dle the knobs and flip the switches of his dream machine."
"Then things began going wrong. The stock closed down nearly $3 to 72.13."
"It dropped to 71.38 the next day and made a lower low a day later. Suddenly,"
"Scott was losing money and his stereo pipe dream was in danger of plugging."
"Should he sell the stock and put off the party for another time?"
"Luck was on his side and prices began climbing again. Soon, they were at"
"74, but the honeymoon did not last long. Prices completed a symmetrical tri-"
"angle but Scott did not see it. They broke out downward through the support"
"trend line (extend the lower right diamond diagonal toward the triangle). The"
"stock even gave him another chance to get out at a profit when it attempted a"
"pullback to the triangle boundary. Scott was busy making party plans and missed"
"the signal. When he received a call from his broker in mid-June reporting that"
"the stop took him out at 69.88, Scott scratched his head and wondered what"
"went wrong. Do you know the answer?"
"The answer is greed. Since he needed money for a stereo, once prices"
"cleared the top of the diamond, he should have put a limit order to sell at his"
"target price. Although this technique limits the profit potential (because you"
"get taken out even though the stock may double after that), it allows a trader"
"to capture the turn near a high point. I have seen this behavior with event pat-"
"terns. Prices shoot up, hit the target and then just as quickly decline. If you do"
"not sell, you lose your profit. An example from my own trading: A few days"
"ago, a stop-loss order sold my position in Rohm & Haas for a $113 profit in an"
"earnings flag trade. If I used my profit target, I would have made $1,000."

"Focus on Failures"
"Figure 12.5 shows a typical diamond top failure. The diamond may look odd"
"by its unsymmetrical appearance, but does it qualify as a valid diamond? Yes."
"The price trend leading to the pattern is up, there are plenty of trend line"
"touches in the pattern, and volume diminishes from being high on the left to low"
"on the right—all are ingredients of a properly selected diamond top. Breakout"
"volume, however, is timid, falling well short of the peaks posted during the"
"prior three days."
"Is low breakout volume the reason why prices failed to descend far (just"
"3%)? Maybe. A high volume breakout would have given more confidence to a"
"bearish situation and perhaps prevented a pullback. I have noticed that high"
"volume downward breakouts pull back less often than do low volume ones."
"This makes intuitive sense, as a high volume descent tends to push prices down"
"farther than a low volume one."
"Perhaps the key to this failure is like many others: Support below the pat-"
"tern stops the decline. On the weekly chart (not shown), support appears in"
"August 1996, February 1996, and May 1995, all with prices peaking near 17."
"Coupled with a bullish general market, the rising tide lifted all boats and pre-"
"vented this one from sinking."
"Based on this chart, if this were my trade, I would have seen the support"
"in July (point A) as a warning sign. That would be my guess as to how far prices"
"would drop. Indeed, they do stop at that level in April, but that is well after the"
"pattern fails."

"back’s hooking pattern caught his attention, and he searched for a nearby chart"
"pattern. In this case, he saw a diamond top, but was it a valid diamond or just"
"cubic zirconia?"
"Lorenzo reviewed the identification guidelines and found that prices were"
"rising into the pattern, verifying a top. The diamond shape, although pushed"
"to one side, had an adequate number of touches of each diamond boundary (the"
"trend lines). Volume receded from the middle of the pattern to the end, so it"
"had a downward trend. In fact, the entire volume shape appeared domed. Dome-"
"shaped volume for diamonds in a bull market with an upward breakout was a"
"decent choice (not the best or worst; see Table 12.7)."
"Breakout volume was high but nothing to write home about and well below"
"the peaks of a few days earlier. Prices also gapped upward, suggesting buying"
"enthusiasm. However, he knew that breakout day gaps resulted in performance"

"He computed the predicted price target using the diamond height pro-"
"jected upward from the breakout price and saw that the target was at the high"
"end of the resistance zone. Thus, it looked likely that prices would throw back"
"there. That meant watching the stock closely and selling when it neared the"
"target to maximize profits. On the down side, if prices dropped, he would close"
"out his position just below the diamond bottom (point B)."
"Two days after prices closed the gap in the throwback, he bought and"
"received a fill at 43. In the days that followed, the stock dropped, and he knew"
"from experience that many of his trades either did well immediately or fell"
"apart. This looked as if it were going to result in a loss. He placed a stop-loss"
"order to sell at 37.93. That was below the round number support at 38 and just"
"below the diamond bottom."
"Prices climbed. When they closed above the prior minor high, point D,"
"he raised his stop to just below point E, a nearby minor low. Prices continued"
"higher for two more days then retraced their gains, attempted another high"
"(point F) and then started a long slide."
"From experience, Lorenzo knew that a failure of price to make a higher"
"high (at point F) was a bearish sign, but he hoped price would rebound. It did"
"not. Instead, price gapped down and tripped his stop. The stock sold at 40.98,"
"for a 5% loss."
"What did he do wrong? I would not have taken this trade because of the"
"overhead resistance. Since there are plenty of chart patterns in other stocks"
"under more promising circumstances, why take one with high risk and limited"
"profit potential? On the plus side, he used a stop-loss order and raised it as"
"prices climbed. Eventually, the order took him out for a small loss. That is the"
"way it should work when a trade goes bad. Let your profits run and cut your"

"The double bottom pattern is one of the easier patterns to identify, but I have"

"Downward price trend. Look for price to be tending downward into the"

"2002), suggests that performance improves for patterns with trends leading to"
"the pattern less than 6 months long. Most of the time (58%), a short-term (0 to"
"3 months) downtrend precedes the pattern."
"Bottom shape. The shape of each bottom should appear similar. That"
"means both should look narrow, not one wide and one narrow, perhaps with a"
"long, downward price spike or tail. To gauge the width, look at the top of the bot-"
"tom. I know that sounds confusing, but the top end of the spike will be wider"

"Sample Trade"
"Randy traded the stock shown in Figure 13.6 and made a tidy sum of money. Let"
"me tell you how he did it. First he qualified the pattern as a true double bottom"
"by reviewing the identification characteristics listed in Table 13.1. Briefly, the"
"stock started down in early January after a long-term uptrend that began in"
"February 1995. The twin bottoms were narrow with one-day downward spikes."
"The rise between bottoms measured 29%; the bottom lows were 1% apart in"
"price and separated by 64 days. Oddly, the right bottom showed higher volume."
"He placed an order to buy the stock at the confirmation price. Thus, he would"
"get in at a good price and received a fill at 20."
"The stock struggled by moving sideways for a week then achieved liftoff."
"Price climbed until early June when it started retracing. The retrace turned"
"into a throwback when price pierced the confirmation line at 20. Prices moved"
"up again and retraced, forming the handle of a cup-with-handle pattern. Randy"
"drew a down-sloping trend line along the handle, and the day after price closed"
"above the trend line, he bought more, receiving a fill at 22.73."
"He computed the target price for the AADB (24.50, see the “Measure rule”"
"in Table 13.8) and smiled when prices passed that, moving up. Then, he drew"
"an up-sloping trend line following the contours of the handle (called the “Sell"
"Trendline” in Figure 13.6). He vowed to sell the day after price closed below the"
"trend line, which it did in late November (not shown), and he received a fill at"
"32. That was down considerably from the high at 38.19, but he made 60% on"
"his first trade and 41% on the cup-with-handle trade."

"Add the difference, 3.52, to the confirmation point, or the highest high"
"between the two bottoms (that is, 31.09 + 3.52). Again, the highest high is"
"point A. The result, 34.61, is the expected minimum target. You can see in the"
"chart that prices meet the target in late December. A few days after meeting"
"the target, prices momentarily descend before resuming their climb. During"
"mid-April, the stock reaches its ultimate high price of 40.26 before declining."
"After you locate a potential double bottom, review the selection guide-"

"Identification Guidelines"
"How do you identify an EADB? While it is easy to find a double bottom, it can"
"be difficult to distinguish between the combinations of Adam and Eve bottoms."
"Figure 15.2 shows another example of an EADB. Although the figure does not"
"show the pattern confirming (a close above the highest high between the two"
"bottoms), the pattern does confirm (off the chart to the right), meaning that it"
"is a valid double bottom."
"Notice the different shape between the two bottoms. The Eve bottom is"
"wider and rounded looking. The Adam bottom is more V shaped, narrower, and"
"usually composed of one or two large downward price spikes. The Eve bottom"
"also has spikes, but they are many and short."
"Figure 15.3 shows another example of an EADB. This Eve bottom has"
"longer spikes than those in Figure 15.2. The Adam bottom appears congested"

"Identification Guidelines"

"cases, you have to know what to look for. Not just any two bottoms at the same"
"price level will suffice for a double bottom. Listed in Table 16.1 are guidelines"
"that make correct selection easier. While considering the guidelines, look at"
"Figure 16.2."
"Downward price trend. The stock begins declining in mid-October"
"1993 from a price of about 56.50. It bottoms out at about 41.50 in mid-May."
"Prices never drop below the left low on the way to the bottom. The reason for"
"this guideline is that you should use the two lowest minor lows on the price"
"chart. Do not try to select one low and then a nearby low just to satisfy the guide-"
"lines. The two points marked A and B in Figure 16.2 represent an incorrectly"
"selected double bottom because point A has lower lows to the left of it."
"Bottom shape. Assign each double bottom pattern into its Adam or Eve"
"category. Adam bottoms are narrow and V shaped, perhaps with a one- or two-"
"day downward price spike. Eve bottoms are wide rounded turns. They may also"
"have price spikes, but they are usually shorter and more plentiful."
"Rise between bottoms. The rise between the two bottoms should be at"
"least 10%, as measured from the lowest bottom low to the rise high."
"Bottom low prices. The bottom to bottom price variation should be"
"small. The basic rule is that two bottoms should appear to be near one another"
"on the price scale. Figure 16.2 shows a price variation of about 1%."

"month is the minimum separation that many professionals view as leading to"
"powerful rallies. I set a lower standard to help verify that this is true. It turns"
"out that peaks close together perform better than those spaced farther apart."
"Price rise after right bottom. Prices should rise up to the confirmation"
"price without first making a third bottom. On average, it takes between 1 and"
"2 months to complete the rise."
"Bottom volume. The volume chart for double bottoms usually shows the"

"right bottom, and the volume trend of the overall formation is downward. None"
"of these are absolute rules. Sometimes volume is highest on the right bottom in-"
"stead of the left. However, on average most of the formations obey the guidelines."
"Confirmation price. The confirmation point is the highest high between"
"the two bottoms, and it is used to calculate the measure rule and to gauge the"
"breakout price (more about that later). Figure 16.2 shows a rise from the right"
"bottom of 15%, above the 10% threshold."

"A double bottom is not a true double bottom until prices rise above the"

"second bottom, your chances of having a successful trade are one in three. In"

"Now that you know what a double bottom looks like, let us discuss how"
"to separate it into its proper Adam and Eve category. Figure 16.3 shows another"
"example of an EEDB but one harder to identify. Both bottoms have a one-day"
"downward spike. However, as you look up the bottom, prices widen. If you were"
"to shave off that one day’s growth, you would have a rounding turn on both"
"bottoms. Adam bottoms are narrower and usually longer."
"A good example of an Adam bottom occurs in December when prices"
"plunge downward for three days. The bottom looks narrow and pointed, not"
"wide and rounded. Notice the different appearance between the Adam and Eve"
"bottoms. When trying to determine whether the double bottom has Adam or"
"Eve components, ask yourself if the two bottoms look similar (Adam & Adam"
"or Eve & Eve) or different (Adam & Eve or Eve & Adam). If they look the same,"
"are the bottoms wide or narrow, pointed or rounded?"
"Let us look at another example, Figure 16.4. The first Eve bottom is nar-"
"rower than the second one and it looks like a widely spaced horn (it has two"

"Measure rule. Use the measure rule to predict a target price. Having a"
"target to aim at may allow you to get out near the peak. If price nears the target,"
"evaluate the situation. Will price continue moving higher or is there a larger like-"
"lihood of a drop?"
"To find the price target, compute the height of the pattern by subtract-"
"ing the lowest low in the bottom from the highest high between the two bot-"
"toms. Add the result to the highest high to get the price target. For example,"
"Figure 16.6 shows an EEDB. The lowest low in the pattern is the left bottom"
"at 14.27. The highest high is 18.39 (the breakout or confirmation price). Add"
"the difference, 4.12, to the highest high to get a target of 22.51. In this exam-"
"ple, price rose to only 20 before dropping."
"You can use Table 16.3 to check your target. In this example, a move of"
"4.12 from the launch point of 18.39 means a 22% rise. Since the EEDB occurs"

"Sample Trade"
"Not all chart pattern trades work as expected, and Figure 16.6 shows an exam-"
"ple. To be sure we are dealing with a valid EEDB, let us run through the iden-"
"tification characteristics. Is the price trending downward to the pattern? Yes."
"Although the figure shows a high in mid-January (B), the stock crested back in"
"mid-November 1999 (not shown)."
"Do both bottoms resemble an Eve bottom? The shape appears rounded"
"in both bottoms. The left bottom comprises two minor lows, but if you exclude"
"the first minor low (shown as point A), the Eve assessment does not change."
"The rise between the bottoms is 29%, and the bottoms are 4% apart in"
"price and 18 days distant (measured from lowest low to lowest low). This is one"
"of the narrower Eve bottoms, but it is still in the 2 to 7–week optimum range."
"Volume is higher on the right bottom than the left in a bear market. This obser-"
"vation suggests slightly better postbreakout performance, but does not guaran-"
"tee it. Price rises up to the confirmation price without first dropping below the"
"right bottom low. The pattern is a valid EEDB."
"What happened after the breakout? Prices climbed enough to clear the"
"confirmation line then threw back and continued down. The stock reached a low"
"of 4.24, recovered, and then dropped more, bottoming at 2.02 in February 2003."
"If you bought at the breakout price and sold at the highest high, you would have"
"made 9%, without deducting commissions or other trading costs. Average"
"traders would have lost money, perhaps a lot of it if they rode the stock down."

"What went wrong? Is this another case of overhead resistance? No. This"
"is a case where the fundamentals take center stage. See that large gap on the left"
"of the chart? Ten days before the gap, a brokerage downgraded the stock. The"
"stock dropped, sure, but it hardly noticed the downgrade."
"On November 29, when the market was closed, the company announced"
"that it would not meet its previous sales projections. When the stock opened the"
"following day, price gapped lower, closing 36% below the prior close. In short,"
"the stock dead-cat bounced; the bounce phase was the rounding turn before the"
"EEDB (point B)."
"A brokerage firm rated the stock “outperform” on the day it gapped lower."
"Such positive statements after a large down gap help drive the price higher in"
"the bounce phase. However, the dire situation eventually catches the hype and"
"the stock sinks . . . sometimes dramatically, like that shown here."

"Upward price trend. Prices must trend upward leading to the pattern to"
"qualify it as a top, not a bottom. The upward price trend can be short, though."
"Top shape. The Adam top should appear as an inverted V, narrow, and"
"many times made of a one- or two-day price spike. Eve tops appear wider and"
"more rounded as the November turn shows in Figure 17.4. Eve tops usually"
"have price spikes that are shorter and more congested."
"Valley between tops. A dip should separate the two tops, making each"
"top stand out as its own minor high. Do not select patterns that are part of the"
"same congestion pattern. For this reason, the peaks marked A and B in Figure"
"17.4 are not part of a double top."
"Top high prices. The price difference between the two peaks is usually"
"minimal, between 0% and 6%. The key is that they should appear to be at or"
"near the same price. The two tops shown in Figure 17.4, for example, have a 4%"
"price variation."
"Top separation. How far apart should the peaks be? Some analysts argue"
"that a month is the minimum, but I put no such limitation on the patterns I"
"selected. However, be sure that the tops are distinct minor highs. The best per-"
"forming AADTs had tops 5 to 7 weeks apart. Those wider than 8 weeks showed"
"performance that deteriorated, but the sample size is small. Thus, do not let"
"widely spaced peaks sway your opinion."
"Price decline after right top. Price must decline to the confirmation"
"price before you consider taking a position, unless the situation warrants a"
"quicker move. Sometimes, instead of confirming, the stock forms another peak,"
"forming a triple top. If that happens, treat the pattern as a triple top."
"Top volume. Volume is usually higher on the left peak than on the right."
"Linear regression on the volume from peak to peak says it trends lower."
"Confirmation price. Wait for price to close below the confirmation line"
"before trading a stock showing a double top. The reason for this delay is that"
"65% of the time, price will not drop to the confirmation line before making a"
"new high. Only after price confirms the pattern does a twin-peak pattern become"
"a true double top."

""
"Focus on Failures"
"Double tops have two types of failures. The first is one of identification. You"
"must wait for price to close below the confirmation line. Only then does the"
"twin-peak pattern become a true double top. You can try trading the pattern"
"before price drops to the confirmation line, but if you are shorting a stock, you"
"will probably take a loss when the price soars away from you. Do the smart thing"
"and wait for price to close below the low between the two peaks before trading."
"The second type of failure is what I call a 5% failure. That means price con-"
"firms the pattern and then drops less than 5% below the breakout price before"
"rebounding. It does not happen often (8% in a bull market and 11% in a bear"
"market), but the chance is not zero. Be prepared and use a stop to limit the loss."

"lines including closing below the confirmation level. The uphill run starts in"
"May 1992 and culminates in the top during March 1993, representing a rise of"
"over 60%. Prices retreat for a month before gathering steam and trying for a"

"However, the celebration is short and prices tumble. They drop over"
"20% before meeting support at 26. The new low is below the valley low, the"
"so-called confirmation point, but prices quickly turn around. Prices move up at"

"you would walk away from a chunk of money."

"For best results, use half the height. Subtract the lowest low between the"
"two highs from the highest high and then divide by 2. For example, in Figure"
"17.6, the highest high is the left peak at 35. The lowest low is at 24.88. That"
"gives a height of 10.12. Dividing by 2 gives 5.06. Subtract this value from the"

"Consider changing the predicted decline into a percentage then looking"
"up the failure rate in Table 17.3. In this example, the 5.06 decline from a break-"
"out of 24.88 represents a loss of 20%. Table 17.3 shows that 63% of the patterns"
"in a bull market fail to drop at least 20%. Thus, the target price is probably too"
"far away, and you should choose a more conservative one."
"Wait for breakout. Usually, it is best to wait for the breakout (when price"
"closes below the confirmation line) before trading this pattern. If you do not"
"wait, chances are prices will rise 65% of the time (in a bull market) without"
"dropping below the confirmation line. The Sample Trade shows an example of"
"how to ignore this rule and make more money."
"Trade with market trend. Even though the average decline is the same"
"in bull and bear markets, the failure rate differs. Trade with the market trend."
"Since this is a bearish pattern, you will have more success shorting a stock if the"
"general market is also trending down."
"Check others in the industry. Other stocks in the same industry can"
"give a vital clue to performance of the stock you want to trade. If they are going"

"Tour"
"Along with the head-and-shoulders formation, double tops are perhaps the most"
"popular. Many novice investors see a dual peak on the stock chart and proclaim"
"it to be a double top. It probably is not. There are a number of characteristics"
"that compose a true double top and I discuss them in a moment, but, first, what"
"does a double top look like?"
"Consider Figure 18.1, a double top in ElkCorp. The first thing one notices"
"are the twin peaks. They should be near the same price level and widely spaced."
"The price trend leading to the first peak is upward and prices fall away after the"
"second peak."
"The intervening valley is just that: a valley that sees prices decline by 10%"
"to 20%, sometimes more. The valley floor forms the confirmation level or point."
"A twin peak formation becomes a true double top once price closes below the"
"confirmation point, signaling a breakout."
"Sometimes a pullback occurs such as that shown in Figure 18.1. A pullback"
"allows investors another opportunity to exit their position before the decline"
"resumes. For more aggressive traders, the pullback is a chance to make a short"
"sale in the hope that prices will continue falling."

"Identification Guidelines"

"They are only guidelines—not rules—and exceptions are many."
"Upward price trend. Figure 18.2 shows an AEDT that forms after a"
"short-term price rise beginning in November. The average rise leading to"
"AEDTs is 128 days, or about 4 months long."
"Top shape. When searching for an Adam & Eve double top, remember"
"that the Adam peak should look different from Eve. Adam looks like an inverted"
"V, usually with a one- or two-day price spike poking out of the top. Eve is"
"rounder and wider. Adam peaks come first; Eve, second. The shape difference"

"Upward price trend                Price trends upward leading to the pattern and should not"

"same consolidation pattern. Look for two distinct minor highs."
"Top shape                         The first peak is an Adam top, usually with a narrow price"
"spike, inverted V shape. The Eve peak (second top) is wider"
"and more rounded, perhaps composed of several short"
"spikes. The two peaks should look different."
"Valley between tops               Patterns with a large dip (a tall pattern) perform better than"
"small (short) ones. The valley depth usually measures in the"
"10% to 20% range, but allow exceptions."
"Top high prices                   Top to top price variation is small, usually 0% to 3%, but"
"allow higher differences."
"Top separation                    Tops should be at least a few weeks apart with most falling"

"Confirmation price                Confirmation is a close below the lowest low between the"
"two tops. It confirms the twin top as a valid double top. The"

"Table 18.2 shows general statistics for AEDTs."
"Number of formations. I found 340 AEDTs in the stocks I looked at. The"
"102 patterns in a bear market put in a good showing because the bear market"
"is much shorter than the bull market. I looked at 500 stocks from 1991 to 1996"
"and another 500 from 1999 to 2003, bracketing the bear market."
"Reversal or continuation. Since we are dealing with double tops and"
"downward breakouts, all patterns act as reversals."
"Average decline. The average decline is higher in a bear market than in"
"a bull market, as you would expect. That suggests trading this pattern in a bear"
"market for the best results."
"Declines over 45%. Twice as many patterns in a bear market decline"
"over 45% than do those in a bull market. That is not saying much because just"
"8% of the patterns make such a large drop."
"Change after trend ends. Once price reaches the ultimate low, it"
"rebounds strongly in a bull market (soaring 50%) and 43% in a bear market."
"This is an average, so your results may vary."
"Busted pattern performance. Busted patterns are rare and probably not"
"worth searching for. Why? Because you may think a double top is about to bust"
"but it turns into a pullback and prices resume the downward trend after the pull-"
"back completes."

"holding. The second is to trigger a short sale. Before we get into a sample"
"trade, let us review the basics."
"Measure rule. Use the measure rule to help predict how far price will"
"decline. Find half the formation height and project it downward from the"
"breakout price. The result is the target, the minimum price move expected."
"Unfortunately, this method only works 69% of the time, far short of the 80%"
"I like to see."
"For example, look at Figure 18.6. The highest high in the Adam & Eve"
"double top is at 28.72, on the Eve top, and the lowest low (the confirmation line)"
"is at 25.78. Divide the difference (2.94) by 2 (1.47) and subtract the result from"
"the lowest low to get a target of 24.31. Price reached the target at point A."
"Wait for breakout. As a trading signal, you will want to wait for the break-"
"out before exiting a long position or opening a short one. The breakout price"
"is the lowest low between the two tops, shown in Figure 18.6 as the confirma-"
"tion line. If you sell your shares before confirmation, there is a 65% chance that"
"price will not decline to the confirmation line but will instead move higher."

"even if the trend is short. For reference, the average price trend leading to the"
"double top in the stocks I looked at was 84 days, or about 3 months long."
"Top shape. Look for two peaks; the left one, Eve, should be wider and"
"more rounded looking than the right one, Adam. Adam is narrow, usually an"
"inverted V shape, and many times with a one- or two-day price spike. Above all"
"else, the two tops should look different from each other."

"Upward price trend           Price trends upward leading to the pattern and should not"
"form a third peak, nor should the twin peaks be part of the"
"same consolidation pattern. Look for two minor highs."
"Top shape                    The left peak is an Eve top, wider and more rounded than"
"Adam, perhaps composed of several short spikes. The right"
"peak, Adam, usually has a narrow price spike, inverted V"
"shape. The two peaks should look different."
"Valley between tops          Patterns with a large dip (a tall pattern) perform better"
"than small (short) ones. The valley depth usually measures"
"in the 10% to 25% range, but allow exceptions."
"Top high prices              Top to top price variation is small, usually 0% to 3%, but"
"allow larger differences. A large price variation (above the"
"median in Table 19.6) suggests better performance."
"Top separation               Tops should be at least a few weeks apart with most falling"
"in the 2–6 week range. Tops wider than 5 weeks tend to"
"underperform, but exceptions occur."
"Price decline after right    Price must close below the confirmation point without"
"top                        first rising above the right top high."
"Top volume                   Usually higher on the right top."
"Confirmation price           Confirmation is a close below the lowest low between the"
"two tops. It confirms the twin top as a valid double top."
"Also called the breakout price."
""
""
""
"In Figure 19.2, the differences between the two peaks in each case are"
"clear. To help gauge the width, look farther down the top, toward the base of"
"the formation. Adam peaks usually remain narrow but Eve broadens out. For"
"example, the May EADT at a price of 29 shows Adam as a one-day price spike,"
"but Eve looks wider."
"Valley between tops. Look for a price dip between the two tops of 10%"
"to 25% or more. The dip separates the two tops so they are not part of the same"
"consolidation region."
"Top high prices. The highest high on the left peak should be 0% to 3%"
"or so away from the highest high on the right peak. The tops of the two peaks"
"should look close in price to each other, but allow exceptions. When the peaks"
"differ in price, they tend to perform better after the breakout."
"Top separation. The average top separation was 51 to 55 days, measured"
"from the highest high in each peak. What you want to see is two minor highs,"
"well separated and defined. Most will fall 2 to 6 weeks apart, but do not worry"
"if they are a year apart. It still may be a valid EADT. However, performance"
"suffers for widely spaced peaks. The thinking here is that it is easier for traders"
"to see twin peaks a month apart than a year apart. If traders miss the pattern, that"

"your stock may descend after the breakout. For example, in Figure 19.4, the"
"Adam peak is the higher of the two, and it tops out at 34.90. The confirmation"
"price is the lowest low between the two peaks, and it is at 31.70. The difference"
"is 3.20. Cut that in half (1.60) and subtract it from the confirmation price. The"
"result, 30.10, is the target. Price reaches that level a day after the breakout."
"Although this works in the stock shown in Figure 19.4, it only works"
"between 72% and 79% of the time. That is shy of the 80% I like to see."
"Wait for breakout. Most of the time, you will want to wait for price to"
"confirm the pattern by closing below the confirmation price. If you do not"
"wait, there is a 65% chance that price will climb instead of confirming. There"
"are exceptions. If you see an especially dire situation developing in a stock you"
"own, then protect your profits and sell early. If the market or industry is drop-"
"ping and there was a quick rise leading to the pattern, then consider selling"
"early (a quick decline often follows a quick rise). Other technical indicators may"
"suggest a sale, so check those, too."

"should look the same."
"Valley between tops           Patterns with a large dip (a tall pattern) perform better"
"than small (short) ones. The valley depth usually measures"
"in the 10% to 20% range, but allow exceptions."
"Top high prices               Top to top price variation is small, usually 0% to 3%, but"
"allow higher differences."
"Top separation                Tops should be at least a few weeks apart with most"
"falling in the 2–6 week range."

"What does an Eve & Eve double top failure look like and can anything be"
"learned from it? Consider Figure 20.4, a common failure of a double top. The"
"twin peaks satisfy all the identification guidelines outlined in Table 20.1 with"
"two exceptions. First, the volume pattern is suspect. Volume on formation of the"
"left top is high but lasts only 1 day. The right top volume is dense, high, and"
"remains high for about a week as the top forms. However, in defense of the for-"
"mation, the volume pattern often varies from the norm and offers little clue to"
"the eventual outcome."
"The second guideline violated is the more important of the two: Prices fail"
"to close below the confirmation point. When considering all twin peak chart"
"patterns in this study, two out of three (65%) perform as the one shown in Fig-"
"ure 20.4. In other words, prices move higher."
"Expect top reversals (such as the double top) to perform poorly in a bull"
"market, whereas bottom reversals should excel. That appears to be the case with"
"many of the formations covered in this book."

"ble top, price soars 63% after reaching the ultimate low. Even if you are late"
"calling the turn, you can still make a profit. Consider the Eve & Eve double top"
"shown in the figure."
"Before you trade this stock, ask yourself if it is an EEDT. Running through"
"the identification guidelines shown in Table 20.1, we find that the price rise"
"leading to the pattern begins at A (far left, bottom). Both peaks look similar in"

"tops. The left peak is more pointed but wider than the right one."
"The valley dips 14% and the peaks top out at about the same price. The"

"ier on the right peak than the left. Finally, the decline to the confirmation line"
"is a straight-line run; price does not form a third peak. In short, this is a valid"
"EEDT when price closes below the confirmation line."
"How do you trade it? For this trade, imagine that you do not own the"
"stock nor do you want to sell it short. The S&P 500 index reached a low in"
"October 2002 and bounced, forming a higher low in early March, right when"

"toming at the same time or were completing a bottom retest (a higher low)."
"334      Double Tops, Eve & Eve"

"What was clear after the March bottom is that everything started moving up in"
"tandem. The industry started recovering, as did the general market (a new bull"
"run). A buy signal occurred when price closed above the down-sloping trend"
"line. The high volume at B (a common bottom phenomenon) also suggested a"
"bottom—panic selling."
"Additional evidence of a major turn comes from points A and B. Point A"
"marks a major turning point for the stock; B, being a higher low, is a retest of"
"that low. Since it did not drop below A, it is a bullish signal."
"If you missed the trend-line signal and higher low at B, then a close above"
"the double top would be another buy signal. With a 63% average rise, you have"
"plenty of time to buy. If you bought at the B low, you would have made 73%."
"Buying at the EEDT high would have made a profit of 36%. The stock topped"
"out at 44.13, by the way, before tumbling back to 32, near the double top high."
"Not all trades will work out as well as this one. A major bull run began"
"after the October low and the industry responded with large gains. Both helped"
"propel the stock higher. A combination of bullish factors is often what sepa-"
"rates a winning trade from a losing one."

"formations usually are shorter than 3 weeks but this is an arbitrary limit."
"Steep, quick price trend. Reliable flags appear during steep, quick price"

"several points in just a few days to a few weeks. In Figure 21.3, for example, the"

"up move preceding it, suggesting the need for caution trading it."

"determine where the trend begins, which is usually the minor high (for down-"
"trends) or low (for uptrends) preceding the formation. Figure 21.6 shows the"
"trend beginning at point A. Subtract the low at the formation start (point B at"
"42.75) from point A (47.50), giving a difference of 4.75. Subtract the difference"
"from the high at the formation end (point C at 43) to give the target price of"
"38.25. Prices reach the target 13 trading days after they move below the for-"
"mation trend line."
"When trading flags, you must first be sure you have a valid formation."
"Use the identification guidelines outlined in Table 21.1 to ensure that you"
"have correctly identified a flag."
"Use the measure rule to gauge the amount of profit likely from the trade"
"and weigh the amount of profit against the possible risk of failure. Look for"
"support and resistance levels where price trends were repulsed in the past."
"Many times prices will pause or turn around at these junctions. These values"
"become the risk points for a trade. You can compare the risk with the reward"
"by computing the current price with the measure rule target and the first or"
"second level of support or resistance."
"For the stock shown in Figure 21.6, the potential reward is 4.75 (that is,"
"43–38.25). The first resistance level is at 44 and there is another at 45 (assum-"
"ing the trade goes against you and prices rise). The risk is one or two, that"
"is, 44–43 or 45–43. The ratio, at 4.75 to 1, suggests this formation is worth"

"For example, let us say you are considering shorting the stock shown in Figure"
"21.6. Since the price trend is downward in a bull market, the statistics suggest"
"that 47% of the formations will meet their price targets, on average. That is a"
"poor showing and deserves caution."
"As the chart pattern forms, you monitor the price closely by not only"
"charting the end-of-day price but also checking it midday. When you dial into"
"your broker for a lunchtime price quote and discover that prices have moved"
"outside the bottom trend line, you decide to pull the trigger. You sell short and"
"receive a fill at 42, just above the closing price of 41.50."

"Identification Guidelines"
"The phrase, high, tight flag, is a misnomer as the formation usually does not"
"resemble a flag formation at all. Sometimes prices move up slightly as the flag"
"progresses, such as shown in Figure 22.1, but more often prices spike down"
"briefly (a day or two), then return and move downward or horizontally before"
"breaking out and heading up."
"The formation was popularized by William J. O’Neil in his book, How to"
"Make Money in Stocks (McGraw-Hill, 1988). In his introduction to the forma-"
"tion, he identifies many characteristics that high, tight flags share."
"Briefly, O’Neil looked for a doubling of the stock price in less than 2"
"months, a sideways move of 3 to 5 weeks during creation of the flag with price"
"drifting down no more than 20% in the flag. The guidelines eliminated many"
"patterns so that fewer than 10% qualified. I followed none of them. I pro-"
"grammed my computer to identify all stocks that had a minimum price rise of"
"100% in 2 months or less. Then I manually went through each stock and looked"
"for a nearby consolidation region. If the region was close to the 100% price"
"gain, then I accepted it as a high, tight flag."
"For example, Figure 22.1 passes all the O’Neil guidelines, whereas Figure"
"22.2 does not (if you apply them strictly). The stock in Figure 22.2 reaches a"

"bers are close enough to the O’Neil guidelines to qualify as a high, tight flag. I"
"accept it as a flag."
"Table 22.1 shows the guidelines I used in selecting and evaluating high,"
"tight flags."
"Substantial rise. First, there must be a short, quick rise. By that, I mean a"
"rise in which price nearly doubles in 2 months or less. It can move up more than"
"that, and the rise need not take place from a flat base (horizontal price move-"
"ment). In the HTFs I found, I visually looked for a doubling of the price in 2"
"months and then let my computer determine when the trend started (see"
"“Trend Start” in Glossary and Methodology for details)."
"Final consolidation. Once the stocks are selected on a price-rise basis,"
"then look for the nearest consolidation area. In my selections, I did not care"
"how long the stock consolidated nor how far the flag descended before turning"
"upward. All that mattered was that the consolidation area was plainly visible to"
"the casual observer. The consolidation area should be about double the price"
"of the prior 2-month low."
"Receding volume trend. The final identification guideline is not really"
"for identification as much as it is for performance. Flags with a receding vol-"
"ume trend outperform those without. However, I would not ignore a high,"
"tight flag simply because volume is rising. Rather, I would recognize that its"
"performance may suffer."
""
""
"Focus on Failures"
"Investing in a stock showing a high, tight flag is not without risk. Figure 22.3"
"shows a flag that suffers from a small rise. Since one would expect a stock to"
"move up substantially after the breakout, I consider this behavior a failure of"
"the stock to perform as expected."

"price reaches 90% of the time. Look for price to stall once it nears the target."
"To find the trend start, see the Glossary and Methodology for details."
"Buy after breakout. Since the price rise in the first week is the largest"
"one-week change you are likely to see, place a stop order to buy the stock just"
"above the HTF trend-line boundary. If the HTF has an irregular shape, use"
"the top of the pattern as the buy point and place the buy stop there."
"If price closes below the flag pattern, sell your position immediately"
"because price is going down. Reversals do happen, so be on guard for one."
"Once you have a position in the stock, raise your stop to just below the prior"
"minor low when price makes a new high. Keep raising the stop as prices rise."
"Eventually, this method will take you out when the trend changes or during a"
"severe retrace."

"Table 23.1 lists identification guidelines for gaps."
"Area gaps. Area, common, or pattern gaps are all names for the same type"
"of gap. The gap forms inside or just after a consolidation region. It is easy to"
"spot as prices seem to hook around and close the gap in less than a week (many"
"times in the next trading session). Figure 23.2 shows many examples of this"
"hook feature: For example, you can see in late March that prices gap down and"
"the next day the high closes the area gap. A quick hook such as that is charac-"
"teristic of area gaps. Usually, few or no new highs (for uptrends) or lows (when"
"price gaps lower) occur immediately after the gap."
"Volume may be high on the day price gaps but usually settles down"
"quickly. You can see this behavior in late January. Volume spikes on the gap"
"day then returns to normal the next day."
"Breakaway gap. Breakaway gaps highlight the start of a new trend. Volume"
"rises substantially above the prior day and price gaps upward and continues rising"
"(or falling in the case of a descending price gap) forming new highs (or lows)."
"Consider the breakaway gap in early January shown in Figure 23.2. You"

"weeks before gapping down in an area gap. Two days later, another breakaway"
"gap (not labeled on the chart) appears and prices reach new daily highs for 3"
"days in a row before settling back."
"The large breakaway gap in mid-April, accompanied by a high volume"
"spike, is not an exhaustion gap because price continues rising. The June break-"

"ation (gap) of the downward price move of a week earlier. Volume spikes"
"upward as price makes a large gap. Usually large gaps are associated with"
"exhaustion gaps, but prices continue moving lower after just a few days."
"Continuation gaps. Continuation gaps occur in the middle of price"
"trends. They do not happen often since it takes a sharp rise followed by a gap"
"and a continued rise in the stock (the reverse for downtrends, too). In Figure"
"23.2, you can see two continuation gaps in August when prices zoom from a"
"low of 23.50 to 32.63 in about 2 weeks. The gaps appear in the quick, sharp"
"price rise on high, but not unusually high, volume. The quick rise forms new"
"highs and the gap remains open (compare these continuation gaps with how"
"quickly the area gap closes). Of course, in a downtrend, prices gap downward"
"and form new lows."
"Ex-dividend gaps. An ex-dividend gap appears on the price chart when a"
"dividend-paying stock distributes the dividend. Usually, however, the normal"
"trading range will cover the gap."
"Exhaustion gaps. Exhaustion gaps commonly follow continuation gaps."
"The highest gap in the August uptrend is an exhaustion gap. At first I thought"
"it was another continuation gap, but the gap is slightly larger than normal and"
"prices pause for 2 days before making new highs. Those are some key factors"
"associated with exhaustion gaps. Excessively wide gaps are most likely exhaus-"
"tion gaps when they appear near the end of a trend. Two exhaustion gaps appear"
"on the chart, one in August and one in September. The September gap closes"
"quickly, which is typical for exhaustion gaps."
"Most exhaustion gaps occur on high volume; it is like the last gasp before"
"prices end the trend. You can see in Figure 23.2 that both exhaustion gaps have"
"high volume, but the September one takes the cake. Volume spikes upward"
"even as prices descend, then volume recedes but remains high for several days"

"Trading Tactics and Sample Trade"
"Table 23.6 lists trading tactics for gaps. To successfully trade gaps you have to"
"be quick, making sure to use stops, and you have to be ready to close out a trade"
"at a moment’s notice. Still, they can be profitable. Consider what Gina did with"
"the situation shown in Figure 23.3."
"As a seasoned investor, Gina knew all about gaps and practiced trading"
"them on paper until she was successful most of the time. The practice honed"
"her skills and pulling the trigger seemed rote. With a focus on limiting her"
"losses, she was growing confident that her trading style was one that would"
"allow her to succeed in the markets, so she took the leap and decided to trade"
"her system for real."
"She followed the stock for a long time and was both familiar and com-"
"fortable with the fundamentals of the company. When she noticed the break-"
"away gap occur on May 10, she quickly checked the identification guidelines."
"Volume was above average (although it may not be clear from the chart) and a"
"new upward price trend seemed to be forming. She called her broker and"
"bought 1,000 shares receiving a fill at 58 that day."
"She placed a stop-loss order at 57, 0.13 below the lower gap rim just to"
"be safe. If this turned out to be an area gap, she would probably be stopped out"
"for a small loss. During her paper trading days, she discovered that most gaps"
"provide near-term support or resistance, so she was confident that her stop"
"would hold."

"Trading Tactic      Explanation"
"Area gaps           These gaps are too short-lived to be traded profitably, consistently."
"Breakaway gaps      If high volume is present at the start of a trend, then trade with"
"the trend. Verify gap type by reviewing the identification"
"guidelines before trading."
"Continuation gaps   Continuation gaps usually mark the halfway point so you can"
"gauge the eventual price move. Measure from the trend start to"
"the gap center and project the difference from the gap center to"
"the predicted high or low."
"Exhaustion gaps     If an abnormally wide gap occurs or a gap occurs at the end of a"
"trend, then close out your position when the trend reverses. After"
"a trend reversal, consider trading the new trend (shorting the"
"stock if the prior trend was up). Violent reversals often follow"
"exhaustion gaps. Close out the trade the day after new highs (for"
"uptrends) or new lows (downtrends) fail to occur."
"Stop loss           The lower rim (for uptrends) or the higher rim (for downtrends) of"
"a gap is a good place to put a stop (0.15 or so away from the rim)."
"Gaps provide near-term support or resistance, so this strategy"
"works well with those gaps that do not close quickly."

"center of the gap. The difference was 5.50 (that is, 60.25–54.75). Adding the"
"difference to the middle of the continuation gap predicted that prices would"
"top out at 65.75, so she placed a stop at 65.50 and moments later, the stock was"

"price, and closed the day at 63.25."
"Not including commission charges, she made $7,500 in just 3 days. But"
"she was not done. The large daily price range on high volume when she sold"
"reminded her of a one-day reversal, but she was unsure. She decided to keep"
"her options open and look for an opportunity to sell short. She followed the"
"stock daily and when it closed below the support level at 61 she decided to sell"
"the stock short and received a fill at 59."
"The next day she was surprised to discover that a large exhaustion gap had"
"formed, dropping the stock down to 49, a $10,000 gain overnight. Knowing"
"that the gap was in reality a dead-cat bounce, she changed tactics and did not"

"24.3, a head-and-shoulders bottom. The formation does not appear at the end of"
"a long-term downtrend but at a short-term one (up to 3 months). The uptrend"
"begins the prior June with another head-and-shoulders bottom. The formation"
"reverses the slight short-term downtrend but continues the long-term uptrend."
"Shape. Overall, the formation sports the three telltale troughs: left shoul-"
"der, head, and right shoulder. The left shoulder is at about the same price level"
"as the right one and appears to be about the same width. Such symmetry is"
"common in head-and-shoulders formations (tops, bottoms, and the complex"
"variety). If the left shoulder is sharp or pointed, the right shoulder will be too."
"The head is below both shoulders by a reasonable amount. By this char-"
"acteristic I mean the formation is not a triple bottom—three troughs at about"
"the same price level."

"Shape                A three-trough formation with the center trough below the other"
"two. It looks like a head-and-shoulders bust flipped upside down."
"The three troughs and two minor rises should appear well defined."
"Symmetry             The left and right shoulders should be opposite one another about"
"the head, somewhat equidistant in both time and price. There are"
"wide variations, but the formation is noticeably symmetrical about"
"the head."

"In Figure 24.3, the left shoulder suddenly declines for 3 days, then"
"reverses and climbs to a minor high. Similarly, the rise between the head and"
"right shoulder climbs almost to the height of the rise between the left shoulder"
"and head then descends to the right shoulder. All five features, the three"
"troughs and two minor rises, appear well defined and distinct. The features are"
"important as you scan your charts looking for head-and-shoulders bottoms."
"Symmetry. Symmetry is another important key to selecting a valid head-"
"and-shoulders bottom. The right side of the formation usually mimics the left"
"side. The right shoulder declines to about the price level of the left shoulder"
"and the distances of both from the head are similar. Of course, there are many"
"variations, but symmetry should make a head-and-shoulders bottom stand out"
"from a sequence of any three depressions."
"Volume. Volume represents another clue to the validity of a bottom."
"The left shoulder or head has the highest volume, with diminished volume on"
"the right shoulder."
"Breakout volume is usually high as it pushes prices above the neckline."
"However, in a quarter of the formations in a bull market, breakout volume is"
"well below the 30-day average. As a rule, volume will rise on the day of the"
"breakout, but it need not."
"Neckline. The neckline is an imaginary line connecting the two rises"
"between the shoulders and the head. It can slope downward or upward. In"
"well-formed formations, the slope of the line is not very steep, but a steep"
"neckline should not be a disqualifier of a head-and-shoulders bottom (see Fig-"

"with a steep up-sloping neckline."
""

"Focus on Failures"
"Like most formations, there are two types of failures. The first type, shown in"
"Figure 24.4, is a failure of the head-and-shoulders bottom to pierce the neckline"
"and move higher. As you would expect, the formation appears after a downtrend"
"in prices. The highest price peak is partly visible in the upper left corner of Fig-"
"ure 24.4. From the high of 38.75, prices fall to the low at the head, 21.25, a"
"decline of 45%. When the bottom forms, it should signal a trend reversal."
"An interesting thing about the formation in Figure 24.4 is that the left shoul-"
"der is almost the same shape as the right. Only a dollar separates the two shoul-"
"der lows and the head is well below both shoulder troughs. The right shoulder is"
"somewhat farther away from the head than the left. This characteristic is typical."
"Volume is suspiciously low throughout the formation. The left shoulder"
"and head register about the same level of volume. The right shoulder volume,"
"however, is higher than the other two. Of course, an irregular volume pattern"
"is no reason to discard a formation—but it serves as a warning."
"After the right shoulder forms and price begins rising, volume tapers off"
"rapidly, and the attempt to pierce the neckline fails. The rally attempt does not"
"even come close to the neckline."

"Trading Tactic            Explanation"
"Measure rule              Compute the formation height by subtracting the value of the"
"lowest low reached in the head from the neckline, measured"
"vertically. Add the difference to the point where prices pierce"
"the neckline. The result is the target price to which prices will"
"rise, at a minimum. For up-sloping necklines, substitute the"
"rise between the head and right shoulder (that is, the highest"
"price in the rise) for the neckline breakout price."
"Wait for confirmation     If you can determine that a head-and-shoulders formation is"
"completing, consider buying the stock. This formation rarely"
"disappoints and the rise is worth betting on. However, you"
"must be sure that a head-and-shoulders bottom is present."
"Otherwise, wait for price to close above the neckline or"
"highest high."
"Stop loss                 Place a stop-loss order below the lower of the two shoulders."
"Often, prices drop to the shoulder lows before meeting"
"support. Raise the stop as prices climb."
"Watch for throwback       If you miss the upward breakout, wait. Half the time, the"
"stock will throw back to the neckline. Once it does, buy the"
"stock or add to your position."

"Measure rule. Use the measure rule to predict the minimum price move"
"once prices break above the neckline. In Figure 24.6, the head marks the low-"
"est price in the formation. Subtract its price from the value of the neckline at"
"that point. In this example, the head has a daily low price of 13.13 and the"
"neckline, measured vertically, is at 17.50. Add the difference, 4.38, to the price"
"where the stock closes above the neckline. This occurs on March 28. I use its"
"daily low price of 15.50 on that day to get a target price of 19.88. Prices reach"
"the target in mid-July."
"Wait for confirmation. If you can determine that a head-and-shoulders"
"bottom is forming, then there is no need to wait for confirmation (that is, for"
"prices to close above the neckline) before placing a trade. With a low failure"
"rate, your guess will get you in at a lower level and yield higher profits. How-"
"ever, this result hinges on the validity of a head-and-shoulders bottom. If you"
"guess wrong, you could see your profits rapidly turn into a loss. If you are"
"unsure whether the price series is indeed a head-and-shoulders bottom, wait"
"for prices to move above the neckline or right neckline high (highest high in"
"the pattern) before investing. That is always the safe play."
"The two shoulders are common support areas. Figure 24.6 shows an"
"example of this characteristic. The lower of the two shoulders, in this case the"
"right shoulder, supports the stock in late October."
"Stop loss. After placing a trade, consider setting a stop-loss point 0.15 or"
"so below the lower of the two shoulders. Should prices decline, they often turn"

"Identification Guidelines"
"Are there certain characteristics that make head-and-shoulders bottoms easy to"
"identify? Yes, and they are outlined in Table 25.1."
"Shape. As discussed before, there are two general types of complex head-"
"and-shoulder bottoms: those with multiple shoulders and those with multiple"
"heads (rarely do you have both). Figure 25.3 shows a complex bottom with"
"multiple shoulders. The head is distinctly below the shoulders, far enough"
"below to distinguish the chart pattern from a triple bottom."
"Symmetry. In this case, there is a normal head-and-shoulders bottom"
"flanked by an additional pair of shoulders. The overall formation appears sym-"
"metrical. The two left shoulders match the two on the right in distance. Fig-"
"ure 25.3 shows a far right shoulder that is higher than its corresponding left"
"one. However, the basic symmetrical pattern is typical for nearly all complex"
"head-and-shoulders bottoms."
"Volume. Figure 25.3 also shows the usual volume pattern: The two left"
"shoulders show higher volume than the two right ones. Overall, the volume"
"trend is a receding one."
"Near horizontal neckline. The neckline connects the highest peak on"
"the left with the highest peak on the right. Most of the time the line is nearly"
"horizontal. Although this is subjective, a scan of all the formations indicates"
"that 74% obey this guideline. Many of the formations shown in this chapter"
"have near horizontal necklines."
"Upward breakout. For those with up-sloping necklines, use the highest"
"high in the formation as the breakout price. Using a steep up-sloping neck-"
"line to gauge the breakout point is risky. Prices may never close above the"
"neckline."
"Once price closes above the neckline, a breakout occurs. Quite often,"
"prices throw back to the neckline and perhaps move lower before ultimately"
"continuing higher. Figure 25.2 shows an example of this behavior during late"
"December when prices plunged from a high of 11.50 to 9.44, a decline of"
"almost 20% in just 2 days! When the decline ended, prices recovered quickly."
"The formation shown in Figure 25.3 is unusual because it acts as a con-"
"solidation of the uptrend. Prices from November through January climb"
"steadily and then resume moving up after the breakout. The formation is a"
"consolidation region, where prices move horizontally for a spell."

""
"Characteristic        Discussion"
"Shape                 A head-and-shoulders bottom with multiple shoulders, multiple"
"heads, or (rarely) both. The head is lower than the shoulders but"
"generally not by very much."
"Symmetry              The tendency for the shoulders to mirror themselves about the"
"head is strong. The price level of the shoulders and time distance"
"from the shoulder to head is about the same on either side of the"
"head. The shoulders also appear to be the same shape: Narrow or"
"wide shoulders on the left mirror the right."
"Volume                Usually higher on the left side than the corresponding shoulders"
"on the right. Overall, the volume trend recedes. Many times,"
"volume is highest on the head."
"Near horizontal       Connects the highest rise on the left and right of the formation"
"neckline             center. Many, but not all, formations have near horizontal necklines."
"Upward breakout       A breakout occurs when price closes above the down-sloping"
"neckline. For those cases with an up-sloping neckline, use the"
"highest price between the head and rightmost shoulder as the"
"breakout price."

"mately, the stock reaches 40.63 in August."
"The left shoulder shows tremendous volume. Volume diminishes at the"
"dual heads, and the right shoulder shows even less volume. Breakout volume is"
"anemic and may explain why the formation fails."

"upward, but prices fail to climb very far before reversing direction. Once prices"

"It took just 2 weeks after the breakout to reach the target, but the stock"
"was not done climbing. It moved sideways for almost a year before continuing"

"and more than double the breakout price."
"Trade inner head and shoulders. Since a head-and-shoulders chart pat-"
"tern is part of the larger CHSB, then trade the inner pattern. Buy when price"
"pierces a down-sloping neckline or use the inner right shoulder high as the"

"Trading Tactics"

"the measure rule as it applies to a head-and-shoulders top. If you ignore the"
"backward volume pattern, the formation looks fine. Each of the three bumps"
"appears rounded and the overall formation is symmetrical."
"Measure rule. The measure rule uses the formation height as a basis for"
"computing the target price. In the head, measure vertically down from the"
"highest daily high until you intersect the neckline. Subtract the value of the"
"neckline from the highest high. The result gives the formation height. In the"
"figure, the stock reaches a high price of 51 on September 13. Directly below"
"that point is the neckline price at about 47.38. The difference of 3.62 is the"
"formation height."
"Once price pierces the neckline, subtract the formation height from the"
"daily high at the breakout point. In Figure 26.5, the high at the breakout is"
"48.50, leaving a target price of 44.88. Prices surpass the target when they"

"top. “It just had that certain feel.” She was correct."
"The right shoulder plunge took prices lower than she expected but"
"quickly recovered to near the left shoulder high. She drew a neckline below the"

"The first shoulder forms as prices touch 27.88, then retreat to a low of 22."
"The decline undoubtedly upset our investor pal. He probably told himself that"
"he would sell the stock once it returned to its old high."
"In early January, prices zoom upward and make a smaller peak at 27.50."
"Since the rise is so steep, our intrepid investor thinks, why sell the stock when it"

"forms the head at a price of 28.63. Once the head completes, things start to go"
"wrong for our buddy. He is swayed by glowing predictions on the Internet of"
"the stock moving up to 35 or 40 within a year."

"Identification Guidelines"
"How can our novice investor recognize the bearish reversal? Table 27.1 out-"
"lines some identification tips of a complex head-and-shoulders top."
"Shape. Consider Figure 27.3, another example of a multiple shoulder chart"
"pattern. After a decline from a head-and-shoulders formation just off the left side"
"of the chart (only the right shoulder appears in the figure), prices decline until"
"reaching bottom at the start of July. Then they rise up, haltingly, and form a new"
"head-and-shoulders formation: a complex top. If you ignore the labels for a"
"moment, the inner price action looks like a rounding top. This smooth price"
"rollover is common for complex head-and-shoulder formations. Of course, the"
"flat head shape for a multiple shoulder pattern (Figure 27.2) is also typical."
"Symmetry. You can divide Figure 27.3 into a pure head-and-shoulders"
"formation by ignoring the outer shoulders. For single-head formations, this is"
"the easiest way to correctly identify a complex head-and-shoulders top. First"
"locate a regular head-and-shoulders pattern and then expand your view to"
"include additional shoulders. In this example, the head rises above the sur-"
"rounding shoulders. The two shoulders are usually equidistant, or nearly so,"
"from the head. The price level of the left and right shoulders is very nearly the"
"same. Thus, the symmetry of a complex head-and-shoulders top is more pro-"
"nounced than that of a regular head-and-shoulders formation."

"two heads. The head is higher than the shoulders but generally"
"not by very much."
"Symmetry                      The tendency for the shoulders to mirror themselves about the"
"head is strong. The price level of the shoulders and time from the"
"shoulder to head is about the same on either side of the head. The"
"shoulders also appear to be the same shape: Narrow or wide"
"shoulders on the left mirror those on the right."
"Volume                        Usually higher on the left side than on the right and usually seen"
"when comparing the shoulders on the left with corresponding"
"ones on the right. Overall, the volume trend recedes."
"Neckline                      Connects the lowest left shoulder trough with the lowest right"

"In a regular head-and-shoulders formation, one shoulder may be higher"
"in price than the other or one shoulder will be much further away from the"
"head—a rather extended shoulder. That is usually not the case with the com-"

"Complex head-and-shoulders patterns suffer two types of failures. Both are"
"rare. Figure 27.4 shows the first type. I define a downward breakout as a close"
"below the neckline, or in the case of steep necklines, a close below the lowest"
"shoulder trough. Figure 27.4 shows price declining below the neckline only"
"once on May 8 but closing above it. From that point, prices rise and move"
"above the highest head and an upward breakout occurs."
"The formation itself is well formed. It has two heads at about the same"
"level and two shoulders also near the same price level. Symmetry throughout"
"the formation looks good, too, as the shoulders are equidistant from the head."
"Volume appears heavier on the left shoulder than on the right, as you would"
"expect. Only during the decline from the right head to the right shoulder does"
"volume rise. In short, there is no real indication that price will fail to continue"
"moving down, but it does."

"drop of $2 at the breakout, but then rises in an ascending broadening wedge"

"Subtract the result from the breakout price where price pierces"
"the neckline. The result is the minimum target price. If the"
"formation looks like a mountain suddenly appearing out of a flat"
"base, prices may return to the base. See Figures 27.2 and 27.5."
"Wait for                     If a simple head-and-shoulders pattern confirms, consider"
"confirmation                trading it without waiting for the CHST to confirm. Place a short"
"trade or sell any long commitments. This formation rarely"
"disappoints and the decline is above average."
"Short stop                   Look for resistance areas about the neckline troughs. Place a stop"
"just above the higher shoulder trough. The shoulder tops and"
"head also represent good locations for stop-loss orders."
"Watch for pullback           Place a short sale or add to the position during a pullback. Wait"
"for prices to begin falling again before placing the trade as prices"
"sometimes pull back and continue moving up."

"Measure rule. The measure rule predicts the minimum expected"
"decline. Look at Figure 27.6 as an example of the measure rule outlined in"
"Table 27.9. Compute the formation height by subtracting the difference"
"between the highest high (31.63) from the value of the neckline directly below"
"the highest high (27). Subtract the result (4.63) from the breakout price"
"(25.75), which is where declining prices pierce the neckline. Prices drop below"
"the target price of 21.12 in early March."
"This is the conventional measuring rule and it is successful between 45%"
"and 53% of the time. That is below the 80% success rate I like to see for mea-"
"sure rules. The conventional method also has a flaw when the neckline slopes"
"steeply. Under such circumstances, prices may never pierce the neckline and"
"yet the stock is tumbling. Fortunately, the neckline rarely slopes steeply in"
"complex formations. However, if you do run across a formation with a plung-"
"ing neckline, use the lowest of the shoulder troughs as the breakout price."
"Compute the formation height in the normal manner, but subtract the height"
"from the trough value to get a target price."
"A slightly more conservative measure rule computes the formation height"
"from the highest high to the higher of the neckline troughs. Then subtract the"
"result from the higher of the neckline troughs and the result is the target price."
"This method works between 51% (bear markets) and 62% (bull markets) of"

"istic of a broadening pattern. Coupled with his fundamental research on the"
"company, he knew it was nearing time to sell, but not yet. He wanted to sell at"
"the top, when prices tagged the top trend line."
"In early February, when prices attempted to reach the previous high, they"
"fell short, dipped down for a few days, and tried again (the two right shoulders)."
"The second rise was even shorter than the prior one, signaling weakness, so"
"Henry started selling immediately."
"The failure to sail across the formation and touch the top of the broad-"
"ening formation meant it was a partial rise. A partial rise in a broadening top"
"usually means one thing: A downward breakout will follow."
"By the time the stock pulled back up to the base of the two right shoul-"
"ders (point B), Henry had sold his holdings. As he was getting ready to leave"
"his office for home, something on his computer screen caught his eye. The"
"broadening pattern had changed into a complex head-and-shoulders top."
"There were the two left shoulders balancing the two right ones with a head"
"perched in the center."
"Henry discussed the new situation with his mentor and his fund manager"
"buddies, then decided to short the stock. By the time prices reached the long-"
"term up trend line, he had a tidy sum sold short."
"Two days later, prices tumbled. They dropped 20% or $5 a share in 1 day"
"and continued down. In less than a week, they were at 16 before finding some"
"support, a plummet of 36%."
"Henry had studied the behavior of dead-cat bounces, and he pulled out"
"his notes and brushed up. He knew the stock would bounce upward, usually"
"within a week, then trend lower."
"True to form, prices moved up a bit (to 18.13), but it was not the smooth,"
"rounded bounce he expected. In the coming days, prices moved lower, so"
"Henry quit complaining, but he watched the situation closely."
"The stock bottomed out at about 16 and trended horizontally. To him, it"
"looked as if the stock were building a base and preparing for an upward move,"
"so he covered half his short position. In late April, when prices jumped up to"
"18.50, he immediately covered the remainder of his position."

"Identification Guidelines"
"How do you correctly identify horn bottoms? Table 28.1 shows identification"
"characteristics."
"Weekly chart, downward spikes. Horns are visible on weekly charts."
"Although they appear on daily charts, weekly charts make selection easier. For"
"the formation on the left in Figure 28.2, the chart shows two long, downward"
"price spikes separated by a week. The low of the center week stays well above"
"either of the spike lows, emphasizing the inverted horn shape of the formation."
"Looking back over the months, you can see that there are no downward"
"spikes that come near the length of the horn spikes (as measured from the low-"
"est low to the lower of the two adjacent weeks). The twin horns mark an"
"unusual event, one that an investor should pay attention to."
"Clear visibility. For the left formation in Figure 28.2, the horn appears"
"after a downward price trend, allowing clear visibility to the left of the forma-"
"tion, as no downward trends or price outliers obscure the view. This visibility"
"is important in that the formation should stand alone and not be part of a con-"
"gestion region. It should mark the turning point of a downward price trend."
"The formation shown on the right of the chart in Figure 28.2 is what a"
"horn bottom looks like in an uptrend. There is a small price retrace, of 3 weeks’"
"duration, just as the horn bottoms out. These few weeks separate the formation"
"from the surrounding price action and allow easy recognition."
"The two spikes share the same low price, 14.50, and have good price"
"overlap (as the right spike almost completely overlaps the left one). You can"

"Identification Characteristics"
"Characteristic       Discussion"
"Weekly chart,        Use the weekly chart and locate two downward price spikes"
"downward spikes     separated by a week. The two spikes should be longer than similar"
"spikes over the prior year and be well below the low of the center"
"week. The formation should look like an inverted horn."
"Abnormally long spikes result in better performance."
"Clear visibility     In a downtrend, the horn lows should be well below the"
"surrounding lows, especially to the left of the formation for several"
"weeks (or months). Usually, horns appear near the end of declines"
"but also happen on retraces in uptrends (where visibility is less"
"clear to the left)."
"Confirmation         The pattern becomes a valid horn bottom when price closes above"
"the highest high in the 3-week pattern."

"ure 28.3, a 5% failure or a horn bottom. A 5% failure is when prices start out"
"in the correct direction but falter (rising by no more than 5%), turn around,"
"and head back down. The twin, downward price spikes look good in that they"
"are long and with good overlap. They form as part of a retrace from the high,"

"move even higher. If you believe that this stock will form a second top, then"
"this formation is probably not worth betting on as the price appreciation"
"potential is just not exciting."
"If you look at this formation differently, you might suspect that it will"
"form a head-and-shoulders top. The left shoulder is already visible in late May"
"1994 and another shoulder could form as part of a mirror image, probably in"
"April or May of 1995. If that is the case, then you should also pass this one up"
"as the right shoulder might top out at about 16. This theory assumes prices"

"Measure rule         Subtract the highest high from the lowest low in the horn pattern"
"and add it to the highest high. The result is the target price."
"Identify             Use the characteristics outlined in Table 28.1 to correctly identify a"
"horn bottom. The week after the right horn is key. Prices should"
"climb smartly and the weekly low should not be anywhere near the"
"horn low (in other words, the horn should still look like a horn and"
"not be encroached on by the succeeding price action)."
"Uptrends             Some horns appear near the end of uptrends, so watch for the"
"trend to change."
"Downtrends           Horns will usually not mark the end of the downtrend, but they"
"will be close. Prices might continue to drift down for $1 or so"
"(below the lowest horn low) and then head upward."
"Stops                If you can afford the loss, place a stop $1 below the lowest horn to"
"reduce the chance that a retest of the low will stop you out."

"should climb after the twin horn spikes. If you need to wait an extra week or"
"two to prove this occurs, then do so."
"Uptrends. Separate the price trend leading to the formation into either"
"an uptrend or downtrend. Horns that appear late in uptrends may mark the"
"end of the upward price move. Prices continue moving higher (perhaps by"
"10% or so), then stop. Of course, if your horn appears at the start of an"
"uptrend, then prices might well be on their way to a large gain."
"Downtrends. Horns in downtrends are common. On the one hand, if the"
"downtrend is just a retrace of the prevailing uptrend, then refer to the uptrend"
"guideline. In such a case, if the horn appears after an extensive advance, then"
"the uptrend may be nearly over. Invest cautiously or look elsewhere."
"On the other hand, if the stock has been trending downward for a long"
"time (for months anyway), then the end might be in sight. The horn probably"
"will not mark the low exactly, but it should be close. Usually, horns appear a"
"month or so before or after the actual turning point."
"If prices are trending down and you see a horn forming, you might wait"
"before buying the stock, just to be sure prices have really turned around. For"
"uptrends, consider buying into the situation immediately since prices will only"
"climb away from you."
"Stops. Place a stop loss up to $1 or so below the lowest low. For low-"
"priced stocks, this may mean taking a significant loss. In such a case, perhaps it"
"is best to skip the trade and look elsewhere. The reason for placing the stop"
"well below the lowest horn low is to allow prices time to turn around. Prices"
"sometimes curl around and retest the low (moving $1 or so below the horn"
"low) before recovering and trending upward."

"she placed a stop at 30.88—0.12 below the lowest horn low. She suspected that"
"this might not be low enough, but a 12% loss was all she was willing to tolerate."
"In early December, her worst fears were confirmed. She was stopped out"
"as prices plummeted from 33 to 29. Three weeks later the stock hit bottom at"
"28.50 and turned around. From high to low, the decline lasted just over 3"
"months, as she predicted, and measured 19%. Prices moved swiftly upward and"
"topped out at 57, exactly double the low."

"Identification Guidelines"

"recognize. Consider the horn shown in Figure 29.2."
"Weekly chart, upward spikes. Use the weekly chart to facilitate identi-"
"fication. Look for twin price spikes that are separated by a week."
"Clear visibility. The two spikes should be well above the surrounding"
"prices (clear visibility) and a good distance from the high in the center week. If"
"you look back over the price history for the year, the two spikes should stand"
"out and be larger than most other spikes. In Figure 29.2, you can see that the"
"price spike in late September is the only real competition (for the period"
"shown, anyway)."
"The high-to-high price variation between the two spikes is usually small,"
"but need not be."
"Confirmation. Confirmation occurs when price closes below the lowest"
"low in the chart pattern. Only when that happens does the 3-week pattern"
"become a valid horn top. Do not trade a horn top without confirmation as price"
"is likely to continue rising."

"upward and never look back, whereas others begin moving down, falter, and"
"then recover and climb significantly. The latter case, the so-called 5% failures,"
"are predominant with horn tops. Prices fail to continue down by more than 5%"
"before recovering and heading higher. However, 5% failures are rare."
"What can be learned from examining the failures? Most horns warn about"
"a coming decline by forming less than 2 months ahead of schedule. That find-"
"ing is worth knowing. If a horn fails to call the turn in a stock you own, be alert"
"to a possible trend change coming soon."
"You can improve your investment performance if you consider the over-"
"all environment for the stock. Look at the horn top pictured in Figure 29.3."
"After trending down for a year, the stock pierced the down-sloping trend line,"
"signaling a trend change, and moved higher. Then the horn top formed."
"In situations like this, after a long downtrend, a stock usually bounces up,"
"curls around, and retests the low (but not always). So when the horn formed, it"
"probably signaled the price top before the retest. Although not shown in Fig-"
"ure 29.3, the stock did move lower, but it first bobbled up for a few months (to"
"63.50). Ultimately, the stock dipped to 49.13 before recovering."

"ing top. Sometimes the horn calls the turn exactly while at other times it is off"
"by a few months (usually it precedes the turn but sometimes it lags)."
"If the horn appears on a downtrend, that is fine. The formation is simply"
"implying that the trend will continue moving down. However, should the horn"
"appear after an extended downtrend, then the possibility of further declines"
"may be in jeopardy. This behavior is especially true if the horn appears after a"
"long downtrend when prices are beginning to move up again (they are retrac-"
"ing some of their losses). Often the retrace signals a trend change. You will be"
"buying into a situation in which you believe prices will fall and retest the low,"
"but prices will dip slightly and then head higher."
"Be cautious when selling short after a long downtrend, and be especially"
"cautious if the downtrend has ended and the horn seems to mark the end of an"
"upward retrace. Do not expect prices to fall far. They do occasionally but the"
"majority of the decline has already passed."
"Low volume. Spikes with volume below the 1-month average show"
"lower failure rates while improving the average decline in a bull market. That"
"is worth considering before you place a trade."
"Trend change. Even if a horn top fails and prices drop by less than 5%,"
"there is a chance that the horn is a premature signal of a bearish trend change."

"may be just a few months away."

"Sample Trade"
"You might be saying, “Those bromides are all fine and good, but how do I"
"really trade it?” Consider the situation in Figure 29.4 faced by Sandy. She"
"watched the complex head-and-shoulders formation take shape in a stock she"
"owned. Volume on the far left shoulder was higher than during the head, as"
"expected, and volume on the far right shoulder was further diminished. All in"
"all, it was setting up to be a dire situation. When she spotted the horn top"
"forming on the right shoulder, she knew the end was near."
"Two weeks after the right horn spike appeared, she sold her holdings in"
"the stock for a tidy profit, but she was not finished. The following week, she"
"shorted the stock at 34.25. Her calculations using the measure rule for the"
"head-and-shoulder formation indicated a decline to 16. This was higher than"
"the 12 predicted by the measure rule because she used her sell point instead of"
"the breakout point (which was not reached yet so she had no idea what it was)."
"With the stock selling at 34, a drop to 16 seemed too optimistic. Still, she"
"watched with glee as the stock plummeted. In rapid order it fell to about 25"
"before meeting support. Sandy scanned the weekly chart looking for support"

"characteristics."
"Shape. Both types of reversals, tops and bottoms, are set off by gaps. The"
"gaps appear at or near the same price level but are typically not the same size."

"0.38 wide."

"Identification Characteristics"
""
"Characteristic        Discussion"
"Shape                 Gaps set off both island tops and bottoms and share all or part of"
"the same price level. Most times, prices move away from the gaps"
"leaving the island with a clear view of the opposing gap (the left"
"gap usually does not close quickly)."
"Rising trend          Tops have prices that lead up to the left gap and fall away from"
"the right gap."
"Falling trend         Bottoms have prices that lead down to the left gap and rise away"
"from the right gap."
"Volume                Volume is usually high on the breakout day (the day prices make"
"a second gap and form the island) but need not be."
"Time                  The island can be from one day (a one-day reversal) to several"
"months long. Some analysts have suggested that islands are quite"
"short, up to a week or two, with relatively flat price zones, but I"
"placed no such restrictions on them."
""
""
""
"As far as identification goes, the gap in mid-December 1991 (point C)"
"should not be paired with the gap in late October (point A) since they are not"
"at the same price level. Even though the price pattern looks like an island"
"because it is set off by gaps, it is not an island reversal by the traditional defin-"
"ition. The gaps must overlap prices or be quite close to one another. In this"
"study, all islands have price gaps within 0.13 of one another and are at least"
"0.25 or larger. In addition, I did not consider one-day reversals (islands com-"
"posed of 1 day) as part of this study. I believe that such islands are too difficult"
"on which to base an effective trading policy."
"Price trends. Consider Figure 30.2, which shows several island reversals."
"The first two islands happen as part of a retrace in a downtrend. The small"
"island tops last for about a week before prices resume their downward plunge."
"The island bottom forms after an extensive decline that sees prices drop"
"from a high of 36.50 to 12 in less than 5 months. The exhaustion gap occurs on"
"very high volume and prices that day have a very large 3.50 trading range. The"
"gap remains open until prices gap upward in late January. Looking at the bot-"
"tom formation overall, it looks like a complex head-and-shoulders bottom."
"Marked on the figure are the dual shoulders and duplicate heads. The volume"
"for the head-and-shoulders pattern is what you would expect: highest on the"
"left shoulder, diminished on the head, and quite low on the right shoulder."
"Only after price gaps upward does volume spike higher for 2 days before recov-"
"ering and trending downward."
"The island top on the right of the figure is somewhat difficult to spot"
"because of the large gap on the left that matches the small one on the right. It"
"only takes a few days for prices to reach their high before easing down. When"
"prices gap lower at the end of March, volume does not budge."

"Sample Trade"
"Consider the situation faced by Clarence as illustrated in Figure 30.5. He"
"watched the semiconductor company’s stock plummet. During November and"
"December, the stock formed a long island consolidation. He knew it was not a"
"reversal because the two gaps did not line up across from each other. Then"
"another island formed in January to early February."
"Since prices gapped down to the second formation then gapped up away"
"from it, he knew he was dealing with an island bottom, a better investment"
"choice for performance than an island top. He used the measure rule to gauge"
"the likely price to which the stock would climb. The target represented nearly"
"a 30% rise in price, large enough to risk a trade."
"Before he bought the stock, he made a few checks. He saw that the trend"
"was down, as the stock had fallen from a high of 61.13 to the island low of"
"17.50. Clarence drew the trend line from the highest high downward and saw"
"it go through the right island gap. This was a good sign as prices had moved"
"above the line and closed there. It signaled a possible trend change."
"Still, something did not feel right about the stock. It had made a new low"
"and the semiconductor industry as a whole was soft. Did the island bottom"
"really mark a turning point or would the stock simply rise up, spin around, and"
"retest the low? He was unsure, so he decided to wait and see if prices threw"
"back to the formation. If they threw back then continued higher, he would buy"

"The long island is a new pattern, but one I am sure many of you have seen"
"before. When I first started looking for island reversals years ago, I thought"
"long islands qualified. They do not. The difference between a long island and"
"an island reversal is the gap alignment. With island reversals, the two gaps"
"must share the same price. With long islands, the gap price is usually different."
"When I started searching for long islands, I found them everywhere, so I"
"raised the qualifications until I had a workable number. The Identification"
"Guidelines section discusses the qualifications I settled on."
"Long islands are average performers. Most of the time, the break-even"
"failure rates are quite low and the average decline is good. The average rise is"

"Unaligned gaps. Look for two gaps that do not share the same price. If"
"they do have prices in common, then you are looking at an island reversal. I did"
"not exclude island reversals in my study of islands, but they made up only 18%"
"of the samples. An island reversal is also a long island, but a long island is not"
"necessarily an island reversal."
"Wide gaps. Small gaps occur frequently, so I looked for gaps at least $1"
"wide. This parameter cut the number of islands dramatically, but I still found"
"almost 1,000 in just over 200 stocks."
"Short length. I chose islands that were less than 4 months long. This"
"time frame is longer than a fiscal quarter (3 months) and yet is not too long to"
"be invisible (think of a double bottom with bottoms a year apart . . . how many"
"traders will notice?)."
"U-shaped volume. When price gaps, volume usually explodes then"
"recedes. This behavior gives the typical long island a U-shaped volume pattern."
"Do not exclude a long island simply because of the volume pattern, especially"
"since those with dome-shaped volume usually perform better."
"Islands in sequence. When multiple islands appear in the same price"
"trend, they tend to get shorter in length. Figure 31.2 shows an example of this"
"behavior. The first island on the far left (gaps 1 and 2) is wider than the fol-"
"lowing one (gaps 2 and 3) and island 3–4 is the shortest of the lot. The 3–4"
"island marks the end of the uptrend."

"Focus on Failures"
"Figure 31.3 shows what an island failure looks like. The figure is an example of"
"what happened to airline stocks when the tragic event of September 11, 2001,"
"occurred. The stock market closed for a week and when it reopened, airline"
"stocks gapped downward (gap 1). From then on, price continued lower for sev-"
"eral days, then bounced, and made a slightly lower low. Then the stock recov-"
"ered and formed a symmetrical triangle."
"In mid-November, the stock gapped downward (gap 2) and other airline"
"stocks also showed weakness on that day, but I do not know why. I do know"
"that it was less than 2 weeks after the release of quarterly numbers. The down-"
"ward breakout was short-lived as price recovered the next day and continued"
"moving higher."
"This is a good example of the need for a stop-loss order. A stop would"
"have limited losses if a trader shorted the stock after the downward breakout."
"Without a stop, a trader would have seen the price climb from a low of 14.85"
"to a high of 35.25 less than 4 months later, a rise of 137%."
"The good news is that losses of this nature, where price moves less than"

"in Table 31.2 that most of the continuations occur when the breakout direction"
"is in line with the market trend (bull market, up breakout and bear market,"
"down breakout). More reversals occur when trading against the market trend."
"Reversals outperform continuations in a bear market when long islands have an"
"upward breakout."
"Average rise or decline. The bear market performance is quite good,"
"but the bull market performance is below the average of other chart pattern"

"the market closes. Seeing the downward gap at point 2, I would have asked my"
"broker for a quote and found price moving higher (note the intraday low the"

"risk a short sale?"

"and participate in an average 48% recovery (see Table 31.2, “Change after"
"trend ends,” and note that this is not a busted pattern because prices drop 8%)."

"above it, forming an island reversal (point 2 and the following day forms a 2-"
"day island reversal). That was the buy signal. Watching the other airline stocks"
"take the lead and move higher, it would be easy to hold onto this stock."

"Characteristic       Discussion"
"First leg            Usually begins from a new high. Prices decline rapidly in a straight-"
"line fashion. Avoid declines that curve (they are rounding turns,"
"scallops, or saucers)."
"Corrective phase     Prices can move horizontally but usually rise and recover from 38%"
"to 62% of the prior decline before resuming the downtrend. If the"
"corrective phase nears or rises above the first leg high, look"
"elsewhere."
"Second leg           The slope of the first leg down trend line often carries onto this leg."
"Both legs usually fit inside their own trend channels."
"Avoid                For cascading measured moves, use the first retrace and not later"
"ones as they get progressively closer to the end of the trend. Avoid"
"horizontal, saw-tooth consolidation regions and measured moves"
"that rise from a flat base. Make sure the measure rule does not"
"predict prices will fall below zero."

"Second leg. When the second leg begins, the downturn resumes. Prices"
"usually follow the slope set by the first leg but this varies from formation to for-"
"mation. Of course, the two legs will not share the same trend line since the cor-"
"rective phase offsets them. Even so, the second leg usually fits inside its own"
"trend channel as prices decline in a straight-line fashion. The second leg"
"decline approximates the price decline set by the first leg and the time it took"
"to accomplish it."
"Avoid. There are several guidelines that you should follow when search-"
"ing for the measured move down. Avoid formations that show a rounded first"
"leg, where prices move lower but curve around in a sort of rounding turn, scal-"
"lop, or saucer. The trend should be a straight-line decline."
"During the corrective phase, prices should not rebound (or come close) to"
"the high set by the first leg. If prices near or rise above the first leg high, then"
"avoid the formation."
"Watch for consecutive measured moves in a declining price trend. The"
"downtrend eventually will end, so it is best to trade on the first or second mea-"
"sured move and avoid the rest."
"Occasionally, the prevailing price trend will be horizontal. Prices rise up"
"and reach a high then begin down in the first leg. When prices return to the"
"base, they bounce. This bounce, wrongly interpreted as the corrective phase of"
"a measured move down, is really a minor high in a consolidation trend. Prices"
"return to the base and may bounce several more times before beginning a sus-"
"tained move upward. The overall picture looks like a horizontal saw-tooth for-"

"Then, prices decline following a down trend line and stay within the trend"
"channel until mid-August, when they reach a low of 51.50. The corrective"
"phase begins on volume that is high but not unusually so. Prices move up and"
"retrace 68% of the decline before tumbling again. In the second leg, prices"
"move below the low (point B) and continue lower to point D. Then it is over."
"The second leg is steeper than the first leg and covers the ground in about"
"half the time (36 days versus 19 days). In addition, the second leg is slightly"
"shorter than the first one (the first leg declines by 8.13, whereas the second one"
"falls 7.25)."

"There are a number of identification mistakes that I want to point out. Figure"
"32.3 shows the first one. The semiconductor maker’s stock reaches a high,"
"along with a host of other chip makers’ stocks, in the summer and fall of 1995."
"The stock forms a head-and-shoulders top in August and September before"
"burning out. In a near straight-line run, the stock tumbles from a high of 33.50"
"to a low of 9.13."
"If this decline marks the first leg of a measured move down, how far will"

"first leg. If we run through the computations, we discover that the predicted"
"decline is minus 9.13. Even if the company were to declare bankruptcy, its"

"Another key to this failure is the size of the corrective phase. Usually,"
"prices recover 38% to 62% of the first leg decline, but this one does not come"
"close (about a 25% retrace). With larger price declines, the corrective phase is"
"proportionally larger too. However, the formation in Figure 32.3 does not"

"Characteristic        Discussion"
"Downward trend        A downward price trend that lasts from a few weeks to over a year"
"usually precedes the start of the formation. The formation begins"
"a trend change that usually starts from near the yearly low."
"First leg             Most times prices follow a trend channel upward before entering"
"the corrective phase."
"Corrective phase      Prices decline, usually between 40% to 60% of the first leg move,"
"before heading upward again. The retrace is usually proportional"
"to the first leg rise: Large retraces follow large rises. Sometimes the"
"corrective phase resembles a saw-tooth pattern (a few sharp rises"
"and declines in a row) before prices break away and zoom"
"upward. This saw-tooth pattern usually associates with a long"
"price climb leading to the formation."
"Second leg            Prices rise, loosely following the slope of the trend line set by the"
"first leg. Prices commonly fit inside a channel as they rise, but this"
"behavior is not a prerequisite."
"Avoid                 Avoid formations where the retrace travels too far down the first"

"Trading Tactics"
"Table 33.5 shows trading tactics for measured move up formations."
"Measure rule. The measure rule predicts the level to which prices will"
"rise. To estimate the target price, compute the height of the first leg. I use the"
"measured move up formation shown in Figure 33.4 as an example. Locate the"
"highest high in the first leg. Usually this is somewhere near the beginning of"
"the corrective phase, and point A indicates this in the figure. From this value"
"(21.13), subtract the lowest low (14.13) in the first leg, shown as point B. The"
"difference (7) is the height of the first leg. Add it to point C (18.38)—or the"
"lowest low in the corrective phase—to arrive at the target price. In this case,"
"the target price is 25.38. Prices reach the target just 10 trading days after the"
"corrective phase ends."
"Using the full length of first leg projected upward works 45% of the time"
"in a bull market and 56% of the time in a bear market. A better method is to"
"use half the first leg move. That would work 85% of the time in a bull market"
"and 99.6% of the time in a bear market. Do not let the bear market number"
"fool you. Your trade may be the exception."

"conservative measure, use half the first leg height. Decide if the"

"the stock form a double top. Prices declined from a high of 24.13 to the low of"
"14.13 at the start of the measured move."
"Unfortunately, as a novice investor, she was unable to pull the trigger and"

"breathed easier. Still, she vowed to do better the next time. As the stock started"

"rectly identified it."
"Since there was no way to tell which direction the stock would break out"

"breakaway gap or an exhaustion gap? She reasoned that since the gap appeared"
"just after a region of consolidation, it was most likely a breakaway gap, so prices"
"would continue rising, but how far? She hoped the triangle represented the"
"halfway mark of an up move. She knew that symmetrical triangle formations"
"sometimes act like half-staff formations, so she expected a climb to 28 (see the"
"measure rule for symmetrical triangles). To her it sounded like a long shot, but"
"one worth waiting for. Her calculated price target of 25.38 was met the day"
"prices jumped out of the triangle."
"About a week after prices left the triangle, they reached a new high and"
"then fell back. When price closed the gap in the first part of September, she"
"decided to sell her holdings. Fortunately, the next day prices zoomed upward"
"and she was able to sell her shares at 24.50, near the daily high of 25.13. After"
"that, the stock tumbled back to the middle of the corrective phase, right in the"
"center of the support zone. Then, the stock recovered. As the stock climbed and"

"You can see in Figure 34.4 that prices loop around the formation end"

"Prices should continue down immediately after piercing the trend-line bound-"

"ure 34.5 shows an example. The trend starts at point A and climbs to the pen-"
"nant. Take the difference between the top (intraday high) of the pennant at its"
"start (B at 10.69) and the trend start low (point A, at 7.50) to get the trend"
"height of 3.19. Add this value to the intraday low at the pennant end (point C"
"at 11.44, the day before the breakout) to get the price target (14.63). Price"
"climbs to the target 3 days after the breakout."
"Warning: This method works between half (bear markets) and two-thirds"
"of the time (bull markets), so be conservative in your estimate."
"Wait for breakout. Since pennants do reverse on occasion, it is best to"
"wait for the breakout. A breakout occurs when price closes outside the pennant"
"boundary. Only then should you take a position in the stock. Do not procras-"
"tinate, as delays will be costly."
"Close out the trade. Price should move in the direction of the prevail-"
"ing price trend, usually following a slope similar to that before the pennant."
"When price falters (pauses), sell."
""
""
"Sample Trade"
"Consider the situation shown in Figure 34.5. The pennant obeys the identifi-"
"cation guidelines shown in Table 34.1. The pennant looks odd because price"

"After researching the performance of horn tops and bottoms, the natural thing"
"to consider is removing the intervening week and testing the pattern again."

"discovery with a low failure rate (5%) and a high average rise (45%) in a bull"

"gains less than 20%. However, there are a number of large gains; almost a"
"quarter of the formations (23%) have gains over 50%."

"should have low prices near the top of the pipe. This characteristic makes the"
"pipe stand out on the price chart as an easily recognizable formation. For exam-"

"average downward spike length over the past year. It must appear as a large"
"decline on the price chart, not just another 2-week blip in a sea of long down-"

"35.2 as the left side of the pipe is just slightly taller than the right side. As a"

"volume perform better than all other combinations. However, I would not"

"shows two such failures. The two pipes in April and May show good definition."
"They look like pipes, but they do not act like pipes. After the pipes complete,"
"prices should move up smartly, but they head lower instead. Why? Volume on"
"the left spike of both pipes is below the monthly average. However, the right"
"side shows higher than average volume in both formations. Still, the volume"
"pattern is unconvincing, as it usually appears most brisk at pipe bottoms. As a"
"contrast, look at the pipe on the far left side of the chart. Both spikes show vol-"
"ume that is well above average."
"Another clue to the failures lies buried in the guidelines outlined in Table"
"35.1. Prices should drop unusually far during the 2 weeks, more than most down-"
"ward price thrusts during the year. As you look at the chart, you can see several"
"downward, 1-week spikes (December and February, for example) that nearly"
"equal the length of the two pipe formations. The entire chart seems filled with"
"ragged price spikes of varying lengths. For this reason, you should be skeptical"
"of investing in these two pipes."
"The pipe failures shown in Figure 35.3 are not pipes at all because price"
"does not close above the highest high in the pattern. Thus, a trader would not"
"trade these patterns."
"Incidentally, before we leave Figure 35.3, it is a good time to illustrate a"
"somewhat common feature of pipes. Since pipes often appear at the end of a"
"downward price trend, prices sometimes rise up, loop around, and retest the"
"low. The pipe in early December 1991 is an example. Prices bounce upward,"
"round over, and fall back on themselves, forming a new low at 98.13. The"
"retest of the original low completes in late March."
"Pipe bottoms exhibit support at their lows. Rarely do prices drop more"
"than a half a point or so below the pipe low before recovering and beginning"
"an extended upward trend. The half point is not an absolute rule as it depends"
"on the price of the stock (the one shown in the chart is a $100 stock and it"
"drops $1 below the prior low)."
"So even though you may buy into a stock above the top of the pipe and"
"watch prices fall, hold on."

"trend leading to the formation. Pipes often occur at the"
"bottom of a retrace in an upward price rise or mark the end"
"of an extended price decline."
"Buy                       After a pipe bottom passes the identification characteristics"
"shown in Table 35.1, buy the stock."
"Stop loss                 Pipes act as support zones but prices sometimes dip up to"
"half a point below the pipe low, so use that as your stop-loss"
"point. Raise your stop as prices climb."
"Wait for confirmation     Wait for price to close above the highest high in the pattern."

"Buy. Once you have identified a confirmed pipe bottom on the weekly"
"scale, buy the stock. Since a stock will often retest the most recent low before"
"starting on a sustained journey upward, be prepared for it."
"Stop loss. Place a stop-loss order half a point (to allow room for the"
"retest to drift below the pipe low) below the lowest pipe. If hit, then prices are"
"probably going to continue down. In such a case, close out your position and"
"send a letter home asking for more money!"
"Wait for confirmation. The pipe confirms as a valid pattern when price"
"closes above the highest high in the pipe, which usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to"
"occur. That interval gives enough time for the pattern to show good visibility"
"on either side of the pipe, meaning that it should look like a well-defined pipe"
"with price rising after the pipe bottom, not making new lows."
"Even if you miss the breakout, consider trading this pattern. You have 4"
"to 6 months before prices typically peak, and with a rise averaging 45%, you"
"should still have plenty of profit opportunity."

"Identification Guidelines"
"Table 36.1 outlines the guidelines for correctly identifying pipe tops."
"Weekly chart, upward spikes. First, use weekly charts as they make"
"pipes easy to spot. You should see two adjacent upward price spikes. The twin"
"spikes should be unusual in that they should be well above the surrounding"
"prices and taller than most other price spikes throughout the year."
"Large overlap. The two spikes should show a large overlap between"
"them; one spike should not be significantly shorter than the other, and they"
"should have many prices in common."
"Small price variation. The peak-to-peak spike price difference is small,"
"with the median being $0.35 and the average, $0.64."
"Upward retrace in a downtrend. If you look at enough pipe tops, you"
"will discover that many form as part of an upward retrace during a downtrend"
"such as that shown in Figure 36.2."
"The twin highs of the pipe are just $0.13 apart and are well above the sur-"
"rounding high prices. Except for the spike in mid-March, the price spikes are"
"unusually tall when compared with other spikes throughout the prior year."
"Since the pipe spikes both share the same low price, the two spikes exhibit a"
"large price overlap."

"Focus on Failures"
"The vast majority of failures occur when prices decline by less than 5% before"
"resuming their upward trend. These 5% failures do not happen that often, but"
"their occurrence is significant enough to warrant a review of the situation."
"Many failures occur when prices are trending up. The uptrend ranges"
"from several months to over a year, and the pipes seem to signal a coming trend"
"change. Sometimes they do and prices drop, but by less than 5%. At other"
"times, the drop is more severe, but it is in the future, from 2 to 5 or more"
"months ahead. In between the pipe and the drop, there are higher prices."
"Sprinkled among the uptrend failures are those related to downtrends."
"Pipes usually appear at the end of a long downtrend or shortly after the trend"
"changes and begins moving up. Instead of an upward retrace in a downtrend,"
"the pipe marks the turning point for higher prices."
"Consider Figure 36.3, a pipe top in a stock that has been moving sideways"

"Focus on Failures"
"Figure 37.3 shows a rectangle bottom in a downtrend. Since most rectangle"
"bottoms (55%) act as consolidations of the prevailing trend, the breakout is"
"expected downward. Prices drop away from the support line at 54.75 and 2"
"days later pull back to the formation. Prices move horizontally for several days"
"before ultimately climbing above the top of the rectangle. When prices pierce"
"the top rectangle trend line and close above it, I consider the downtrend over."
"Since the initial decline moves just 3% down, the formation is a failure."
"Formations that do not move in the breakout direction by more than 5% are"
"what I call 5% failures. Although this formation ultimately moves lower, it"
"does so only after closing above the formation top. If you sold this formation"
"short expecting a price decline, you might have been stopped out for a loss."
"Certainly, your worry would have climbed along with prices."
"What stops a price decline after a rectangle breakout is what stops it for"
"other chart patterns. When buying demand exceeds selling pressure, the price"
"will rise. If this continues over time, a trend change occurs and price rebounds."
"What causes buying demand to surge is manifold: improving fundamentals,"
"underlying support, bottom fishing among novice traders, insider buying—"
"that sort of thing."

"Statistics"
"Table 37.2 shows general statistics for RBs."
"Number of formations. I searched through 500 stocks from mid-1991"
"to mid-1996 and another 500 from 2000 to 2003 to capture the bear market. I"
"found fewer RBs than I hoped, 374, split between market conditions and"
"breakout directions."
"Reversal or continuation. Since rectangle bottoms must have price"
"entering the pattern from the top, an upward breakout represents a reversal of"
"the price trend, and a downward breakout is a continuation. If you do the math"
"using the numbers in Table 37.2, you will find that RBs act as consolidations"
"of the price trend 55% of the time."
"Average rise or decline. The best performance from RBs comes in a bull"
"market with an upward breakout. In fact, when the breakout is in the same"
"direction as the general market, the pattern performs better. For example, RBs"
"in a bear market with downward breakouts show declines averaging 25%, but"
"those in a bull market decline an average of just 14%. This behavior shows the"
"market’s influence, and it reinforces the belief that you should trade with the"
"general market trend."
"Rises or declines over 45%. Bullish chart patterns always do better than"

"Sample Trade"
"Figure 37.4 shows a paper trade I made. The rectangle bottom appeared after"
"prices dropped from a high of 20.63 in October 1997. The drop was a painful"
"one but it did not occur all at once. Prices dropped quite rapidly to 15 where"
"they moved horizontally for 8 months. Then the second half of the decline"
"took over and prices reached a low of about 11."
"Prices bounced off the low several times, like a boy taking his first steps"
"on a trampoline. They were tentative, shaky, with not much enthusiasm. Then"
"in mid-October 1998, prices touched the bottom trend line and moved quickly"
"across the formation to tie the September high at 12.38. A few more oscilla-"
"tions and the two trend-line boundaries became apparent."
"If you look at the overall picture, you might think that prices would con-"
"tinue down—a downward breakout (following the downward trend). I could"
"not tell which direction prices would go, so I decided to wait for the breakout."
"If the formation acted as a consolidation, then the breakout would be down-"
"ward. However, with a two-step downtrend from the high at 20.63, this"
"reminded me of a measured move down with a long corrective phase. I thought"
"it might break out upward. If the rectangle were taller, I would try an intrafor-"
"mation trade (buy at 11.13, sell at 12.38, and then reverse)."
"In early December, prices pierced the top trend line and closed above it;"
"staging an upward breakout. I noticed the breakout the day after it happened"
"and bought the stock 13, midrange for the day."
"578      Rectangle Bottoms"
""
""
"I estimated that a support zone had formed at 11.75, so I placed a stop at"
"11.63. Prices had stopped at this level just before the chart pattern formed and"
"again just before the December breakout. A better stop would have been just"
"below the lower rectangle trend line because both trend lines act as support or"
"resistance zones. However, I did not want to take such a large loss (15%+)."
"Even paper trades go wrong and that is what happened here. A day after"
"buying the stock, prices returned to the rectangle formation to do more work."
"Prices slowly, agonizingly, moved lower until hitting my stop in late Decem-"
"ber. I took a paper loss of 11%. After a second upward breakout, price contin-"
"ued rounding over, then dropped, and finally hit bottom at 8.88 in March 1999"

"For Best Performance"
"The following list includes tips and observations to help select RBs that perform"
"better after the breakout. Consult the associated table for more information."
""
"• Review the identification guidelines for correct selection—Table 37.1."
"• Trade with the prevailing market trend: go long in a bull market and"

"• Rectangles in bear markets with downward breakouts have the lowest"
"failure rates for declines up to 10%. After that, rectangles in bull mar-"

"• Select rectangles with upward breakouts in the middle of the yearly"
"trading range; downward breakouts near the yearly low—Table 37.4."
"• Throwbacks and pullbacks hurt performance, so look for overhead"
"resistance or underlying support before trading—Table 37.4."
"• About half the rectangles with downward breakouts reach the ultimate"
"low within 3 weeks. Watch your short trade carefully. Upward break-"
"outs take longer to top out, so be patient—Table 37.5."
"• Select tall and wide patterns—Table 37.6."

"Identification Guidelines"
"Table 38.1 shows identification guidelines for rectangle tops."
"Rising price trend. Over the short to intermediate term, the price trend"
"should be leading up to the formation. This upward trend is what distinguishes"
"the formation from rectangle bottoms. The distinction is arbitrary; I wanted to"
"see if there is any difference in the way the two perform."
"Horizontal trend lines. As a rectangle forms, prices rise to a resistance"
"level and fall back to a support area for another try. If this pattern continues,"
"the minor highs can be joined with a trend line drawn along the top of the for-"
"mation, and another trend line can be drawn below the minor lows. The two"
"trend lines are horizontal or nearly so. If there is a slight tilt to the trend line,"
"do not worry as long as it does not disturb the overall appearance of a conges-"
"tion region."
"Touches. To qualify as a rectangle, prices must touch each trend line at"
"least twice. The touches need not alternate from one trend line to the other,"
"but the minor highs and lows must be distinct. You do not want to see two"
"touches along the top as part of the same minor high. Instead, look for two dis-"
"tinct hills and two valleys at a minimum."
"Volume. The volume trend varies from formation to formation but usu-"

"price skyrocketing, but in a month or so prices head back down and plane out"
"slightly above where they left off. Then they resume their climb. When the"
"stock reaches the old high, selling pressure usually drives prices lower, forming"

"Identification Guidelines"
"As chart patterns go, rounding bottoms are easy to identify. Table 39.1 lists"
"guidelines for their identification."
"Weekly scale, rounded bowl shape. Since rounding bottoms are often"
"quite long (in this study, the longest is over 21⁄2 years), I usually use the weekly"
"scale to make identification easy. I search for a price pattern that looks like a"
"bowl or saucer. Once I discover the pattern, a quick glance backward usually"
"finds prices trending upward. The rounding bottom is often a gentle retrace of"
"some of the gains."
"Consider Figure 39.2. The most recent up leg of the climb to the forma-"
"tion begins in late December 1991 on very high volume. Prices climb 235% in"
"about 3 months, and then the stock eases over. The decline is not a quick"
"straight-down affair. Rather, the stock moves lower on its way to 4.25 by curv-"
"ing around and flattening out."
"Once prices reach the low, they move hesitantly higher by traveling hor-"
"izontally for several weeks before beginning an accelerated climb. Prices reach"
"the level of the left saucer lip and do not pause. They keep climbing until they"
"reach 13 and then 16 before backing down to 11."

"Identification Guidelines"
"Table 40.1 outlines the characteristics that rounding tops possess."
"Daily or weekly scale. Using either the daily or weekly time scale, prices"
"start moving up from the base of the dome formation. As they move up, they"
"bend over and round off at the top, then continue their rounding turn until"
"they head down and retrace much of the prior rise. Buying demand often cuts"
"the decline short before prices return to where they started."
"Even end prices. Look for the ends of the RdT to be near the same price,"
"say, within 5% (but allow variations). In the 776 patterns I looked at, the bottom-"
"to-bottom price variation averaged 3%, with the end usually slightly higher than"
"the start 52% of the time. What you do not want to select are inverted scallops."
"Those have starting or ending prices well away from the other rim."
"Rounded half-moon shape. The price climb from start to end should"
"appear smooth, as a gentle rounding turn like a half-moon or inverted U. Allow"
"prices to pierce the top occasionally, creating an irregular appearance, and for"
"narrow but tall patterns to look like an inverted V instead of a U."
"Curving volume trend. Volume is often lowest at the center of the for-"
"mation and higher at either end. This observation is just a guideline, not an"
"inviolable rule. Many times you will see an irregular volume trend over the life"
"of the formation. Pay it no heed; it is still a rounding top. What is important is"
"that prices round over and a bowl-shaped volume trend just adds evidence to"
"the veracity of the chart pattern."
"Breakout. The breakout can be in either direction. An upward breakout"
"occurs when price closes above the pattern high, and that happens 53% of the"

"Sample Trade"
"Sharon is a high-energy player. She is the one you see careening out of control"
"when skiing down the expert slope. She is the one you see night after night"
"relaxing in a bar after work, surrounded by men. In other words, she is fun to"
"be with, the life of the party."
"Her investment style mirrors her lifestyle. When she spotted the rounding"
"top pictured in Figure 40.4, she waited for just the right moment to buy. At first"
"she thought it might be a head-and-shoulders top, but the two shoulders and"
"head were at about the same price level and the volume pattern was all wrong."
"In mid-June, when prices began heading up and pierced the down-"
"sloping trend line, she bought the stock and received a fill at 47. Then she held"
"on and watched the stock daily. As prices rose, she noticed that the oscillations"
"from minor high to minor low seemed to be narrowing. To her, these oscilla-"
"tions indicated that a rising wedge was forming, but the volume pattern was"
"abnormal. With a rising wedge, the volume pattern tends to recede over time."
"In early September, Sharon grew alarmed because the volume trend"
"began to decline drastically. Her studies showed a tendency for a severe"
"dropoff in volume just before a rising wedge breakout, so the day after prices"
"pierced the lower wedge trend line, she sold the stock at 62."
"Her analysis was perfect. After she sold the stock, prices pulled back to the"
"lower wedge trend line and hung on for 2 more days before tumbling. At the"
"start of the new year, the stock reached a low of 34.13"

"What impresses me most about ascending scallops is how poorly they perform."
"I consider well-behaved patterns as those with break-even failure rates below"
"20%. In a bull market with a downward breakout, 27% fail to decline at least"
"5%. Upward breakouts perform better, but the 10% or 16% failure rate does"
"not inspire confidence. The average rise or decline is also below par for both"
"breakout directions."
"Perhaps the only redeeming quality of ascending scallops is their ability to"
"predict the end of the trend. Scallops get narrower and shorter, on average,"
"when compared with prior scallops in a series. For example, in a line of three"
"ascending scallops, the first one will be wider and taller than the last one. Also,"
"a downward breakout from a scallop perched at the summit (the end of an"
"upward price trend) is bearish and usually means a trend change."

"Identification Characteristics"
""
"Characteristic       Discussion"
"Price trend          Price should be rising leading to ascending scallops."
"J shape              Look for two price peaks with a rounded recession in between and"
"a higher right peak. Ascending scallops look like the letter J."
"Volume               Ascending scallops often show a U-shaped volume trend."
"Width                Scallops trend to be wider near the start of a trend than near the"
"end, but allow variations."
"Uneven ends          Scallops with price nearly the same at the end as at the beginning"
"suggest the trend is near the end."
""
""
""
""
"J shape. The pattern resembles the letter J. The peak on the left side is"
"below the right side with a rounded recession in between. The two peaks"
"should not be near each other in price (otherwise, you have a cup with handle,"
"rounding turn, or even a double top chart pattern)."
"Volume. Volume usually resembles the price pattern: higher at the ends"
"than in the middle. However, do not exclude a scallop with domed or other"
"shaped volume."
"Width. Wide scallops usually mark the start of a rising price trend and"
"narrow ones appear near the end of the trend. I base this observation on the"
"average scallop width, so sometimes you see just the opposite: a wide scallop at"
"the end of a trend and narrower ones near the start."
"Uneven ends. In a series of scallops, many times the highest scallop in"
"the series will look like a rounding turn or double top with the start and end of"
"the scallop sharing almost the same price. A downward breakout may follow"
"immediately or a trend change will occur soon after. A check of the database"
"shows that scallops with starting and ending prices near each other perform"
"less well than do those priced farther apart."
"Figure 41.2 shows two examples of ascending scallops, the first with an"
"upward breakout and the second with a downward one. An upward breakout"
"occurs when price closes above the highest high in the pattern (point A); a"
"downward breakout happens when price closes below the lowest low (point B)."
"Both patterns have dome-shaped volume, which is unusual for scallops."
"The J shape of each scallop is well defined with the end far above the"
"price at the start. Between the beginning and end is a rounded-looking reces-"
"sion forming the bottom of the pattern. Sometimes the turn looks irregular"
"with a few price bars getting in the way of a curved line drawn along the val-"
"ley lows, but that is fine. Use the figures in this chapter as examples of ascend-"
"ing scallops."

"Focus on Failures"
"Scallops suffer from what I call 5% failures. A 5% failure is when price breaks"
"out in the intended direction but fails to continue moving in the same direction"
"by more than 5%. Price doubles back and heads in the opposite direction,"
"sometimes causing an investor to lose money. Figure 41.3 shows an example of"
"failure."
"There is nothing wrong with the ascending scallop in Figure 41.3 in the"
"April–May period. Prices round up nicely and continue higher while the vol-"
"ume pattern is bowl-shaped if you disregard the twin spikes in early May."
"However, the late June formation marks the high for the stock. Again, there is"
"really nothing wrong with the pattern. The J shape is pronounced and smooth."
"The volume pattern is somewhat rugged but higher on either end than in the"
"center. The narrowness of the formation is a clue to its failure. It is about 2"
"weeks wide, which is quite narrow for scallops (the average width is over a"
"month long). From the high at 19, the stock heads down in a choppy manner"
"until the end of the study (mid-July 1996) where it is at 13.50."

"so, I found comparatively few with downward breakouts, as you might expect."
"Reversal or continuation. Scallops with upward breakouts function as"
"continuations of the prevailing (upward) price trend. Downward breakouts act"
"as reversals of the uptrend with a few sprinkled into a declining price trend"
"(those act as continuations). Reversals perform better than continuations in all"
"cases except downward breakouts in a bear market."
"Average rise or decline. The average rise for both bull and bear markets"
"is less than I hoped to see and below the usual performance for all chart pattern"
"types. Even the downward breakout performance is below par."
"Rises or declines over 45%. One bright light is that 27% of scallops"

"Trading Tactics"
"Table 41.8 shows trading tactics for ascending scallops."
"Measure rule. The first trading tactic is to determine how far prices are"
"likely to move once the formation completes. This gauge is called the measure"
"rule because it involves measuring the formation height and applying it to the"
"breakout point."
"Subtract the lowest low reached in the bowl from the high reached on the"
"right side of the formation. Once you have the height, add the value to the"
"highest high on the right side (upward breakouts) or subtract it from the low-"
"est low (downward breakouts). The result is the minimum expected price tar-"
"get. An example makes the calculation clear. Consider the ascending scallop"
"that forms during late September as shown in Figure 41.4. Apply the measure"
"rule to this formation by subtracting the formation base from the right side"
"high. Point B shows the base low at 12.50 and the right side high, point A, is"
"16. The difference of 3.50 is the formation height. Add the difference to the"
"right-side high (point A) to get the target price of 19.50. Prices meet the tar-"
"get in late April (not shown on the chart). If the scallop breaks out downward,"
"then subtract the difference from the formation low (point B) to get the target"
"price. In such a case, the target would be 9 (12.50–3.50)."
"Handle. Once a scallop completes, prices decline. They retrace all or a"
"part of their gains (that is, from the right-edge high to the bowl low) before"
"heading higher (upward breakouts) or continuing down (downward breakouts)."
"In Figure 41.4, you can see that the retrace after the first scallop brings prices"
"down to the height of the left scallop lip at 14.25. The retrace after the"
"November scallop sees prices return to near the bowl low."
"Buy point. Once prices crest on the right side and begin declining, wait"
"for the decline to end. In some cases, another scallop will form and it will be"
"relatively easy to buy during formation of the bowl."
"Stops. Stop-loss points should be $0.15 beyond the support or resistance"
"level. In Figure 41.4 place a stop-loss order at 12.35, or 0.15 below the formation"
""
"Table 41.8"
"Trading Tactics"
"Trading Tactic          Explanation"
"Measure rule            Compute the height of the scallop by taking the difference"
"between the right-edge high to the lowest low in the formation."
"For upward breakouts, add the difference to the highest right-"
"edge high. For downward breakouts, subtract the difference from"
"the lowest low. The result is the minimum expected price target."
"Handle                  Once prices crest the right lip high, they fall. If they drop below"

"Sample Trade"
"Kristy was intrigued by the scallop formation shown on the left in Figure 41.4."
"The V-shaped look to the bowl concerned her as did the falling volume trend."
"But she liked the prospects for the restaurant company and her fundamental"
"analysis was thorough and tasty."
"Before she bought the stock at point C, she computed the estimated gain"
"and compared it to the risk of a loss. The targeted rise was to 18.75 (she calcu-"
"lated using the right-side peak 3 days earlier). The risk point was 14, the high"
"of the left side and a massive support area reached in early 1994. At her purchase"
"point of 15.25, the risk was 1.25 (15.25–14) and the potential reward was 3.50"
"(18.75–15.25). The nearly three-to-one ratio was high enough to risk a trade."
"She felt gratified when prices closed at the high for the day, suggesting"
"prices the following day would move higher still. When she looked at the stock"
"the next day, prices did reach a new high but closed lower. As she posted her"
"daily quotes for the stock, the declining price trend over the next week or two"
"worried her, but not unduly so. Kristy recognized the rounding turn of another"
"scallop forming and saw that her stop held."

"Day by day she followed the stock and did not like the third scallop in the"
"series (the rightmost one). The bowl shape was irregular with an unconvincing"
"volume pattern. When prices stopped at the old high before collapsing, she"
"knew the rise was at an end. She pulled the plug on the operation at 16.75,"
"shown as point D in the figure, when price pierced an up trend line from the"
"bowl low (not shown)."
"In the short term, Kristy was right in that prices headed lower. They moved"
"down until reaching the low of the bowl but then rebounded. By mid-June, they"
"had nearly doubled, reaching a high of 28.75, 10 points above the target price of"

"The ascending and inverted scallop is a pattern I discovered a few years ago. I"
"then wondered whether ascending and descending scallops had inverted coun-"
"terparts and what they might look like. It did not take long before I discovered"
"the inverted and ascending variety. I thought it showed great promise and"
"studied it briefly before setting it aside. This chapter takes a closer look at the"
"pattern’s performance and explores its many surprises."
"The formation looks like a backward and upside-down J or the right half"
"of an open umbrella. The breakeven failure rate is low, 4% in bull markets, and"
"7% in bear markets, but climbs quickly. The average postbreakout rise is 43%"

"After manually searching though hundreds of inverted scallops, I developed"
"identification guidelines, which appear in Table 42.1."
"Daily chart. I used the daily chart to find the pattern, but I am sure they"
"come out like worms after a heavy rain on most any time scale. The longer"
"ones appear on the weekly chart, but I did not check the intraday chart to see"
"what they looked like or how they perform."
"Upward price trend. I selected scallops from a rising price trend. You do"
"not see them appear in a downtrend (because they do not confirm) except at"
"bullish turning points. The turning point may be the start of a new upward"
"trend, but, more likely, it is the corrective phase of a measured move down. In"
"other words, prices decline and then stop where the inverted scallop forms."

"Number of formations. Since I found 535 chart patterns in over 200"
"stocks from both bull and bear markets, I felt no need to search for more. The"
"first pattern I found appeared in late 1994 and the last in mid-2003, but most"
"were from mid-1996 onward. Splitting the samples into bull and bear markets"
"gives the numbers shown in the table."
"Reversal or continuation. Most scallops behaved as continuations of"
"the prevailing price trend. About a quarter (27% in a bull market and 25% in"
"a bear market) acted as reversals. Scallops acting as reversals performed better"
"than did those acting as continuations, especially in a bull market."
"Average rise. The ascending and inverted scallop is a bullish pattern."
"Perhaps the average rise supports the “rising tide lifts all boats” theory. In a"
"bull market, the average rise was 43%. In a bear market, the rise was 26%."
"Both are above the averages for bullish chart patterns of other types."
"Rises over 45%. Measuring the rises over 45% is a statement of how well"
"the pattern can perform. In bull markets, over a third (39%) of the inverted"

"Sample Trade"
"Robert looked at the chart shown as Figure 42.6 and liked the stock’s rising"
"price trend starting in April. He watched the first scallop form in September"
"and October. The retrace of this pattern, ending at point A, was 83%—more"
"than he liked, so he ignored the potential trade. Such a large retrace may mean"
"an especially weak technical picture, and scallops with large retraces tend to"
"underperform."
"When the second scallop formed during late October through early"
"December, he saw that the retrace was a more palatable 64%."
"He ran though the identification guidelines in Table 42.1 and found the"
"following: On the daily chart, the pattern was in a price uptrend, it looked like"
"an inverted and backward J, the top was reasonably smooth, and prices did not"
"drop below point A, the scallop’s start. Meeting those guidelines qualified the"
"pattern as an ascending and inverted scallop."
"The day after price closed above the scallop’s high, he bought. That tim-"
"ing turned out to be wrong as prices immediately tumbled. Robert is an expe-"
"rienced trader and knows all about throwbacks, so he was not worried. Prices"
"threw back to point C, above his stop (which was placed a nickel below point"
"B), before rebounding."
"Robert likes using trend lines as sell signals. He drew a trend line from"
"point A to point B and extended it upward (not shown). He knew that steep"
"trends tended to be short lived, but the upward climb was not steep enough to"
"worry him. He redrew the trend line (shown) as prices climbed."
"For fun, he computed the price target and it turned out to be 5.95. Prices"
"climbed through the target, pausing around 5, a round number and a common"
"support and resistance zone, but eventually pushed their way through."
"Since prices kept bumping against the trend line without piercing it, he"
"was not worried . . . until early June. That is when prices tumbled through the"
"trend line with meaning. Coupled with excessively high volume a few days"
"earlier, it seemed time to sell. That is what he did the following day (point D)."
"Robert bought at 4.90 and sold at 6.50, for a gain of 33% in about 5"
"months. From that point, it took over a year for prices to make a new high."

"upward price trend. Sometimes you will see a descending scallop form at the"
"top of a long, upward price trend. It acts as a reversal when price breaks out"

"and rounded, not excessively rough or V shaped. Allow variations: Tall but"
"narrow scallops may look more V shaped than wider scallops and often a price"
"spike will poke out downward."
"Ends. The start and end of the pattern (point A and B in Figure 43.1)"
"should be far apart in price. The usual retrace, C to B, of the A to C distance"
"is 60%. In other words, price climbs 60% of the way to A from the bowl low."
"Since this figure is an average, allow variations, but the key is to avoid scallops"
"that look like rounding turns—two ends at nearly the same price."
"Volume. Most of the time, 70%, volume will be dome shaped. I never"
"exclude a scallop because of the volume shape, but scallops with upward break-"
"outs perform better with dome-shaped volume, and scallops with downward"
"breakouts do best with U-shaped volume."
"Figure 43.2 shows four descending scallops. You can see that the overall"
"price trend is downward. It starts on the left at about 20 and saucers down to"
"about 15. The descending scallops appear like reverse J patterns. The minor"
"high on the right is below the left minor high and between the two peaks is a"
"rounded recession. You can see that the last scallop has minor highs that are"
"nearly equal. This feature often suggests the declining price trend is nearing an"
"end. In this case, prices reach the ultimate low in less than 2 months at 13.63,"
"quite close to the last bowl low of 14.75."

"Shape                 A reverse J shape with prices much higher on the left side than"

"Focus on Failures"
"Descending scallops fail most often because of two other chart patterns: sup-"
"port and resistance. Figure 43.3 shows the first example. The July scallop"
"begins at A and ends at B. The bowl has a downward price spike, making the"
"turn less smooth than I like to see. Volume is dome shaped, which is typical for"
"descending scallops. After B, prices move down and it looks like they will drop"
"below the bowl low and complete a breakout. Since price is declining leading"
"to the scallop, down is the expected breakout direction. However, price comes"
"close to breaking out downward, but the close remains above the bowl low."
"When it closes above B at C, the pattern surprises with an upward breakout."
"Prices rise to the height of A and throw back to the price at B. Overhead resis-"
"tance is the culprit. Numerous valleys touch the resistance line and a solid block of"
"horizontal price movement adds strength to the zone in January to March."
"As in most throwbacks, prices recover and attempt a new high that suc-"
"ceeds, but not by much. Overhead resistance is there to swat it down and prices"
"drop below the pattern low. The rise from B to the resistance zone where"
"price stalls measures 5%."
"Figure 43.4 shows the second example of a failure, this time with a down-"
"ward breakout. Prices do not decline far before rebounding and eventually"
"making a new yearly high at 113 (not shown)."

"Why did this descending scallop fail? The only explanation I can offer is"

"If I were trading this stock and saw the downward breakout, I would"

"not trade a scallop until the breakout occurs unless you have a compelling rea-"
"son for doing so. Remember that the breakout direction usually follows the"
"price trend leading to the pattern. For example, if price is trending down, expect"
"a downward breakout. In a strong bear market, an upward breakout may falter."
"Stops. Since scallops perform so poorly, use a stop to protect any profits"
"you may have and to limit losses. A good starting point for downward break-"
"outs is to use point C (see Figure 43.5) as the stop point. For upward breakouts,"
"use the formation low (B) as the stop-loss point."
"Place the stop a few cents below the low (for long trades), preferably on"
"an oddball number (20.93 instead of 21, for example). Every novice investor is"
"going to use a round number, so position your stop below them. They will be"
"stopped out, and you stand a better chance of having your trade left intact."
"Sometimes though, this strategy will cause a larger loss because of stop run-"
"ning. That is when a stop causes price to decline, which trips additional stops,"

"trades). Move the stop to just above the prior minor high (downward break-"
"outs) or below the prior minor low (upward breakouts) as price advances. Since"
"stop running seldom occurs, I place my stop below the round number."

"short the stock only in a bear market. If you own the stock, ask yourself if you"

"the stock and look for a more promising situation instead of riding out a decline."

"Sample Trade"
"Figure 43.5 shows the sample trade for descending scallops. How would you"
"trade the June scallop? The first thing you may notice is that it appears at the"
"end of a long upward price trend. Thus, this scallop acts as a reversal. This fact"
"does not become clear until price closes below point B, the lowest low in the"
"pattern. When that happens, it signals a downward breakout and a trend"
"change. That movement means shorting the stock (or selling shares you own),"
"a risky maneuver that should be left to serious traders and investors."
"Before taking a position in the stock, use the measure rule to determine"
"how far prices will decline. I already discussed this in Trading Tactics, so refer"
"to the measure rule discussion there for more information."
"Look for support and resistance zones. Overhead resistance will probably"
"occur at the old high (in early June at 23.75), perhaps forming a double top."
"Support appears at 19, as shown in Figure 43.5, set up by the base of a"
"right-angled and ascending broadening formation. If price pierces 19, then I"
"would consider it likely to stall at 16. Although not shown in the figure, 16 is"
"the price at which the decline stalled during the summer and fall of 2001."
"Additional support appears as a broadening top, centered near 14 and extend-"
"ing as far back as 1999."
"Since the measure rule target (18.47) and support (at 19) are nearly the"
"same price, that is where I would expect price to stop. If the market were also"
"trending down during the trade, an additional decline to the next support zone"
"(16) might be possible or even likely. Below that might be a dream unless com-"
"pany fundamentals are in serious trouble."
"With a breakout price of 21.11 and a target of 19, is a 5% decline worth"
"trading, especially a risky short sale? I do not think so. Suppose price declines"
"to 16, for a 24% loss. Now we are talking!"
"If fundamental analysis shows the market flooded with nickel, copper,"
"cobalt, or precious metals, all of which Inco produces, then the oversupply"
"should translate into lower stock prices. News such as that would give me con-"
"fidence to short the stock."
"According to Table 43.4, a gap in a bear market suggests a larger decline"
"than without a gap. Suppose you shorted the stock at the close the day after the"
"gap. That would be at 20.45, well below the formation low of 21.11."
"In the coming days, price drops. For short-term traders, consider cover-"
"ing the short once price nears support at 19 or the predicted target of 18.47."
"Many times, the decline will fall short of the target and it may be prudent to"
"take your profits or tighten (lower) your stop. A lower stop allows you to cap-"
"ture more of your profit but still give the stock room to drop farther."
"If you put an order to cover the short at 18.47, you would have missed it"
"because price declined to 18.52 before rebounding for a week. Patience would"
"be rewarded, though, when prices dropped through support and continued"
"down, triggering the order."

"The stock hit 16.05, pulled back to the price target, and then resumed the"

""
""
"Identification Guidelines"
"Table 45.1 shows identification characteristics for 3FP patterns."
"Upward price trend. Since we are looking for three peaks, you are going"
"to have to do some counting. Begin counting with the highest high on the"
"chart where an upward price trend ends and a stair-step decline begins."
"Three falling peaks. The highest high in each peak must be lower than"
"the prior peak. Allow no ties because we are not searching for double or triple"
"tops. The three peaks need not follow a straight down-sloping trend line."
"Proportion. The three peaks should appear similar in size and shape. Do"
"not mix a wide and tall peak with a short, one-day spike. Consider Figure 45.2."
"Peaks A1, A2, and A3 appear similar in magnitude. They are all minor highs"
"and each peak has a lower top than the one before. Notice that the B peaks are"
"much smaller in size and shape but distinguishable as three independent peaks,"
"not three peaks born from the same congestion region. Both A1 to A3 and B1"
"to B3 are valid three falling peaks patterns."
"The reason for the rule about proportion is to avoid confusion about peak"
"selection. Consider peaks C and D. To me, these look like something I missed"
"with my lawnmower. They are minor highs, as are the other A peaks, but they"
"are not in the same league. They are 1- or 2-day spikes that appear out of place"
"with the rounded appearing A1 peak. They are not of the same magnitude or"
"proportion. When selecting the three peaks, I ignored C and D and went with"
"A1, A2, and A3."
"Why not select peak E? This peak is robust enough to join the party, so"
"you could call it the third peak. When A3 comes along, you might question the"
"validity of the A1, A2, E pattern because A3 forms a higher high. The way I"
"looked at the pattern, I liked the idea that you could draw a trend line along the"
"A1, A2, and A3 peaks. Having E as the last peak seems out of place. Also, a"

"Identification Guidelines"
"Figure 46.2 shows an example of the 3RV chart pattern. This one occurs well"
"into the upward price trend, and there are others not shown in the figure that"
"occurred earlier. Points 1, 2, and 3 mark the minor lows. Each valley is above"
"the prior one. Their shape is also similar—wide in this example, not narrow"
"like the cluster in June (point A and to the right)."
"The pattern confirms when price closes above the highest high in the pat-"
"tern. In this example, prices throw back a few days after the breakout and then"
"continue climbing until peaking in September. That peak marks the ultimate"
"high for a rise of 34% in a bear market. Volume is dome shaped in this exam-"
"ple, which is also the most common shape."
"Figure 46.3 shows what a 3RV pattern looks like in a downtrend. The"
"pattern is part of a measured move down but the valleys act as a continuation"
"(consolidation) of the downtrend, not a reversal."
"Table 46.1 shows identification characteristics for 3RV pattern."
"Upward price trend. Look for the pattern in an upward price trend."
"That is where they appear most often. However, those appearing in down-"
"trends actually perform better (a 45% rise for downtrends in a bull market"
"compared with a 36% rise for uptrends) because they act as reversals. If you can"
"find one that reverses the downtrend, buy into the stock and ride the new"
"uptrend. Be sure to use stops to protect your position in case the market"
"decides to teach you a lesson."

"breakout rise may be meager, especially in a bear market."
"Proportion. Each valley should look similar to the prior one. In Figure"

"Confirmation price. Always wait for confirmation. That is when price"
"closes above the highest high in the pattern. It confirms the three valleys as a"
"valid chart pattern worth trading. Entering the trade sooner increases your"
"risk, especially if price was trending down leading to the chart pattern."
"There are exceptions, of course, and the Trading Tactics section dis-"
"cusses them. Figure 46.3 shows an example of when getting in sooner reduces"
"your risk and increases profits. When the peak between valleys 2 and 3 is below"

"Focus on Failures"
"The three rising valleys chart pattern has a small break-even failure rate, but it"
"still fails. Figure 46.3 shows one example. The minor lows marked 1, 2, and 3"
"show rising valleys, each low above the prior one. The minor lows look simi-"
"lar in shape, narrow spikes in this case. The pattern confirms when price closes"
"above the highest high."
"Why did this rising valley fail? I find it valuable to take the big picture and"
"zoom in. Since the pattern begins at point 1, I would notice the measured move"
"down pattern marked by turns B and C (the first leg); the corrective phase, C to"
"D; and the second down leg, D to 1. After a measured move down, the most"
"common retrace is a climb back into the corrective phase, C to D. After that, a"
"resumption of the original trend (downward in this example) is a good bet."
"Since the corrective phase is a solid block of horizontal price movement,"
"it presents a formidable challenge to any price mountaineer willing to attempt"
"the climb. I would not invest in this pattern because of nearby overhead resis-"
"tance and the likelihood of price dropping, resuming the downtrend."
"Note point A, the early confirmation price. A close above this peak con-"
"firms the pattern and leads to a gain of 12%, well above the 2% gain measured"
"from the confirmation line shown in Figure 46.3."

"the left, the rise at 7 connects with the symmetrical triangle to form a diamond."
"He reviewed the “For Best Performance” list and found that the stock was"
"in a bull market (good) with a rising S&P 500 index (good); the breakout was"
"in the middle of the yearly price range (bad); he expected a throwback (bad);"

"was rising (good) and it had a U shape (good). The commodity channel index"
"(CCI) issued a buy the day before the breakout, but the relative strength index"
"(RSI) remained neutral. In short, he faced a mixed technical picture."
"Joshua used the trend-line break method to signal an entry. When price"
"closed above a trend line connecting the two peaks in the pattern, he bought"
"and received a fill at 9.20. He used the measure rule to predict a price target"
"and came up with 11.66, the same height as the July top (far left). If he sold at"
"that price, he would make 27%. Just below that was a solid line of resistance"
"from March to May of 1998 (not shown), at a price of 10.80 and rising to"

"He put a limit order to sell at 11.47, below the predicted target of 11.66"
"and below 11.50, where everyone else would put their orders. If triggered, he"

"pierced the top flag trend line. Price peaked at A and then made two successively"
"lower lows, B and C. This was a three falling peaks pattern and it spelled trouble."

"simple. I read a tutorial in a popular magazine in which nearly half the illustra-"
"tions purporting to be triangles were incorrectly identified. If you have any"
"doubt about the validity of a chart pattern, others may share those doubts. If"
"others do not see the same shapes you do, chances are the pattern will not work"
"as you expect. Under those circumstances, where there is some doubt about cor-"
"rect identification, do not trade the formation. Save your money for a trade"
"where you are sure the formation is valid. I discuss identification problems later"
"in this section. For now, Table 47.1 lists ascending triangle characteristics."
"Triangle shape. The triangle pictured in Figure 47.1 is nearly a classic"
"example of an ascending triangle. The horizontal top line of resistance repels"
"prices and they rebound off a steadily rising support line below. The two nar-"
"rowing lines, one horizontal and the other sloping up, outline a triangular"
"shape. The ascending trend line predicts a rise in prices, hence the name"
"ascending triangle."
"Horizontal top line, up-sloping bottom trend line. The top horizon-"
"tal trend line should have prices that approach and withdraw at least twice (in"
"other words, two distinct minor highs). Similarly, two distinct minor lows sup-"
"port the up-sloping trend line. The two trend lines meet at the triangle apex,"
"but prices usually break out of the formation well before then."
"Crossing pattern. Price should cross the pattern several times, not walk"
"along one of the trend lines. The pattern should look filled with price, not white"
"space. Cutting off a price turn and calling it a triangle is a common selection error."
"Volume. As the triangle forms, volume is heavy at first but tapers off until"
"the day of the breakout. Often volume is abnormally low a few days before the"

"Characteristic        Discussion"
"Triangle shape        Two price trend lines, the top one horizontal and the bottom one"
"sloping up, form a triangle pattern. The two lines join at the triangle"
"apex."
"Horizontal top line    Prices rise up to and fall away from a horizontal resistance line at"
"least twice (two minor highs). Prices need not touch the trend line"
"but should come reasonably close (say, within $0.15). The line need"
"not be completely horizontal but usually is."
"Up-sloping bottom     Prices decline to and rise away from an up-sloping trend line. Prices"
"trend line          need not touch the trend line but should come close (within $0.15)."
"At least two trend line touches (minor lows) are required."
"Crossing pattern      This is an important characteristic. Prices should cross the chart"
"pattern several times; they should not leave a vast amount of white"
"space in the center of the triangle."
"Volume                Volume is heavier at the start of the formation than near the end."
"Volume is usually low just before the breakout."
"Premature             Somewhat prone to premature breakouts, both up and down."
"breakouts           Volume on a false breakout is also heavy, just as the genuine breakout."
"Breakout              Volume is heavy (but need not be) and continues to be heavy for"
"several days.The breakout can be up or down, usually following the"
"existing price trend."
"Price action after    Once prices pierce the horizontal resistance line confirming a break-"
"breakout            out, prices move away from the formation. Throwbacks to the"
"formation top are common. If prices continue to climb rapidly,"
"volume will probably remain high. For downward breakouts,"

"is rapid, in which case volume will probably remain high."

"out is not a premature one? You cannot. A premature breakout is a close out-"
"side the boundaries of the two trend lines. After a few days, prices return to the"
"confines of the triangle and eventually break out for good by soaring above the"
"top trend line. Volume on premature breakouts is indistinguishable from nor-"
"mal breakouts and both occur at about the same distance to the triangle apex."
"Price action after breakout. Once a triangle has a genuine breakout"
"upward, what is the behavior like? Prices rapidly climb away from the triangle"
"but occasionally throw back to the top of the formation. Volume is usually"
"heavy, supporting the rise, and continues to be heavy as momentum gathers"
"speed. Once price levels out, volume returns to normal. If price rises over sev-"

"What about support and resistance? If you consider the triangle as the"
"momentary intersection of two trend lines, you can guess where support and"
"resistance will be. It will be along the two trend lines. Figure 47.2 shows an"
"example of this pattern on the weekly time scale. Notice the generally down-"
"sloping volume trend from the formation start to the week before the breakout."
"Volume spikes upward on the breakout and then generally declines as prices"
"round over and approach 1994. Prices start climbing again, essentially hugging"
"the trend line started by the ascending triangle. The upward trend continues"
"for several years following the triangle-initiated support line. Although the"
"match between the sloping trend line and the slope of the later price action is"
"not exact, the trend is clear. The triangle sports two minor high touches of the"
"top trend line and three on the bottom, numbered in the figure. Trend-line"
"touches and prices crossing the triangle are important selection criteria."
"By now you may feel comfortable with correctly identifying an ascending"
"triangle. However, there are some situations that may fool investors new to the"
"formation. Figure 47.3 shows the first one. Cover up the right half of the fig-"
"ure and ask yourself if what you see on the left looks like an ascending triangle."
"The horizontal line, drawn to rest on top of the central peak, extends to the left"
"and right until it intersects prices. Although the lower trend line has several"
"instances where prices decline to and bounce off of the up-sloping line, the top"
"trend line does not have such a situation."
"Looking at the right side of the chart, does this still look like an ascend-"

"Focus on Failures"
"Figure 47.5 shows the first failure type: a 5% failure. Strictly speaking this is"
"not a 5% failure (because price climbs by 6%), but it is typical of what one"
"looks like. A 5% failure is when price breaks out and moves less than 5%"
"higher before curling around and moving below the formation low. In this"
"case, price leaves the formation at 6.13 and reaches a high of 6.50—a 6% move."
"Most failures of this type have two causes. The first is overhead resistance,"
"and it is easy to spot. Look for peaks or valleys sharing a common price or a"
"solid block of horizontal price movement. Chart patterns, trend lines, and"
"other technical patterns also set up resistance zones. Before investing in a pat-"
"tern, always check for overhead resistance."
"The second cause of failure is when the general market swings against the"
"breakout direction. If the breakout is upward and the market turns down, that"
"may be enough to kill a profitable trade. The same can happen with stocks in"
"the same industry. If competitor’s stocks are going down and yours is the lone"
"holdout, chances are your stock will join the party and tank as well. Check the"

"Trading Tactics"
"Now that you can identify ascending triangles and know their behavior, how"
"do you trade them? Before I give an example of a trade, I discuss trading tac-"
"tics and the measure rule (see Table 47.8)."
"Measure rule. The shape of the ascending triangle suggests prices will"
"rise, but how far? If you compute the height of the formation and add the result"
"to the price of the horizontal trend line, the result is the minimum predicted"
"price. This is called the measure rule. For downward breakouts, subtract the"
"triangle height from the breakout price to get the target."
"An example makes the calculation clear for upward breakouts. Consider"
"the stock shown in Figure 47.6. Calculate the height of the formation by sub-"
"tracting the low (14.38 at the first minor low) from the high (17.63 denoted by"
"the horizontal trend line) at the formation start. The difference is 3.25. Add the"
"result to the highest high—the value of the horizontal trend line—and you get"
"a target price of 20.88. Prices reach the target in mid-July 1992, when they"
"climb to a high of 21.63, about 6 weeks after the upward breakout."
"A more visual approach is to draw a line from the start of the formation"
"(the top left corner) parallel to the up-sloping trend line. The value of the line"
"the day price breaks out of the formation becomes the target price. The figure"
"shows the new line. Be careful when determining where the formation begins"

"Wait for confirmation          Buy the stock when price closes beyond the trend line."
"Sell on measure rule           For short-term traders, sell when price nears the target (see"
"measure rule). For intermediate- and long-term traders, hold"

"You are not alone. Other investors, believing the stock is retesting the low"

"level before buying demand pushes the price higher. This time the stock does"
"not climb as high as the prior minor high; it only reaches a value of 8.13 before"
"turning down. Again, when the stock reaches a low of 7.38, buying demand"
"increases enough to halt the decline at that level and to send the stock moving"
"back up. During the next 2 weeks or so, you and other investors buy the stock."
"Enthusiasm for the stock quickly wanes and a series of lower highs outline a"
"down-sloping trend. The floor, at 7.38, becomes the horizontal support level."
"Eventually, investors buy enough of the stock and have either run out of"

"came between those dates as I found them in my daily trading activities."
"Reversal or continuation. If you add the numbers, you will find that the"
"pattern acts as a reversal 592 times and as a continuation of the prevailing price"
"trend 574 times. Thus, descending triangles are as likely to act as continuations"
"as they are reversals. Do not depend on the breakout direction continuing the"
"trend leading to the pattern."
"When the breakout direction agrees with the market trend (bull market,"
"upward breakout or bear market, downward breakout), reversals tend to per-"

"value to which prices decline after a downward breakout. Compute the height"
"of the formation by subtracting the price of the lower trend line from the high-"
"est high in the triangle. Then, subtract the height from the value of the lower"
"horizontal trend line (downward breakouts) or add it to the breakout price"
"(upward breakout). The result is the target price."
"Compute the height of the triangle shown in Figure 48.5 by taking the"
"difference between the highest high and lowest low (marked by the black dots)."
"The value is 1.44 (that is, 8.82 – 7.38). Subtract the height from the value of the"
"horizontal trend line, or 7.38 – 1.44, giving a predicted price decline to 5.94."
"Prices reach the target the day of the breakout. Since the measure rule suggests"
"the minimum price move, the final decline is often larger. In this case, the stock"
"reached a low of 4.69 in mid-April 1994 for a total decline of 36%."
"An alternative approach, which eliminates the cumbersome math, is to"
"draw a line parallel to the down-sloping trend line starting at the lower left cor-"
"ner of the formation. The value of the line where prices break out of the for-"
"mation becomes the target price."
"Wait for confirmation. Waiting for a breakout to occur is paramount"
"since the direction is unknown ahead of time. If you do not wait for a down-"
"ward breakout before shorting the stock, prices could quickly rise away from"
"you in an upward breakout. However, shorting a stock is not for the faint of"

"when it deviated from the normal pattern. The number of touches from side to"
"side was good, and the minor highs and lows were distinct. He concluded that"

"Jacob was nervous about shorting the stock since it could turn around and"

"his risk if things did not work out. Still, he was uncomfortable shorting and"

"after it fulfilled the measure rule."
"He computed the height of the triangle and discovered that the minimum"
"downward move would take the stock to 12.50. As Jacob watched the stock"
"each day, he saw it break out downward and begin declining. The first time it"
"reached the target price and recovered a bit, he suspected the stock was near its"
"low. At least, that is what he hoped."
"On October 19, 1992, Jacob bought 200 shares of the stock at the close of"
"12.50, exactly the target price he predicted earlier. He placed a stop-loss order"
"at 11.13, slightly below the prior December’s low of 11.25, a support level."
"Then, he looked at the possible reward and believed the stock would rise to its"
"old high of 17. He sat back and waited."

"Identification Guidelines"
"Table 49.1 lists identification guidelines for symmetrical triangles."
"Shape. Consider Figure 49.2, a symmetrical triangle with a premature"
"upward breakout. The overall shape of the formation is triangular and defined"
"by two trend lines: One slopes downward from the top and the other slopes"
"upward from the bottom so that they join at the apex."
"Touches. Numbers mark the minor highs and lows, which touch or come"
"close to each trend line at least twice. That feature is important as the touches"
"should be distinct individual hills (minor highs) and valleys (minor lows)."
"White space. Price must cross the triangle several times, covering any"
"white space."
"Volume. The volume pattern has a downward slope to it. Turnover may"
"increase when price rises and declines when price falls, but the overall trend is"
"receding. Let me say it is unusual for a symmetrical triangle to not have a"

"Identification Characteristics"
"Characteristic        Discussion"
"Shape                 A triangular shape forms within the confines of two trend lines,"
"one sloping up and the other down so that they intersect at the"
"triangle apex. The trend lines need not be the same length."
"Touches               There should be at least two distinct minor highs and two minor"
"lows that touch the trend lines (in other words, at least four"
"trend reversals)."
"Volume                Usually recedes throughout the formation but can be irregular"
"and is often very low just before the breakout."
"White space           Price should cross the pattern, covering much of the white space."
"Breakout direction    Unknown ahead of time. Occurs when price closes outside the"
"trend-line boundary."
"Duration              Typically longer than 3 weeks, at a minimum. Formations 3"
"weeks or less classify as pennants."

"Use one or both measure rules as appropriate to the situation. The first"
"method, using the formation height, is the more conservative of the two and"
"more likely to be fulfilled."
"Trade with trend. It is difficult or impossible to determine in which"
"direction price will break out. Generally, it continues the prevailing trend."
"Even in Figure 49.6, although the formation acts as a short-term reversal of the"
"downward trend, the longer-term trend is upward (not shown in the figure)."
"Wait for breakout. Always wait for a breakout. Occasionally, price"
"squeezes out the triangle apex and has no breakout at all. This is a rarity, but it"
"does happen. Once price breaks out, trade with the trend: Go long if price"
"breaks out upward and short on downward breakouts."
"Trade busted patterns. I have noticed that even when price breaks out"
"in an adverse direction (a reversal of the prevailing trend), it quickly reverses"
"again and resumes the original trend. This means, for example, in an upward"
"trend price breaks out downward and falls by 5%, then heads back up and fin-"
"ishes much higher. Figures 49.2 and 49.3 show examples. This behavior for"
"reversals is something to watch out for, especially for downward breakouts in"
"a raging bull market. Trading these busted patterns can be profitable."
"Intrapattern trade. Another way of trading triangles is to buy near the"
"lower trend line, sell near the upper one, and then go short. Occasionally, a"
"symmetrical triangle is tall enough and long enough that you can profitably"

"The price level of the three valleys is nearly the same, in this case, within"
"$0.38 of one another. That feature is a key element of triple bottoms as we see"
"in the Identification Guidelines section."
"Each chart formation is unique with characteristics that distinguish it"
"from other patterns, and the one in Figure 50.1 is no exception. The stock"
"reaches a low in mid-October 1992, after trending down for 5 months. Then"
"prices retrace their losses and stray into new high territory before heading"
"down to the first triple bottom low. Support reached during formation of the"
"first low is set up by the peak back in May 1992. Prices climb to the 37 area sev-"
"eral times from January to May but fail to burst through the resistance."
"The multiple hits on the ceiling are in no small measure responsible for the"
"support the triple bottom encounters. As prices descend to 37, investors willing"
"to part with their shares at the lower level are scarce. When someone does offer"
"to sell, buyers snatch the stock believing they are getting a good bargain. They"
"are right. Prices do not meander at the 37 level for long. If you look closely at"
"Figure 50.1, each valley floor is a 1-day downward spike, albeit small but visible."
"The start of the formation, from the first to the second bottom, looks like"
"a broadening top, right-angled and ascending, with its horizontal bottom and"
"up-sloping top trend line. However, there are not enough price crossings to"
"validate the formation. It always makes me nervous when I see plenty of white"
"space in a formation (such as that shown between the first and second bot-"
"toms). When the rise between the second and third troughs fails to come any-"
"where near the up-sloping trend line, the jig is up."
"Prices stop rising at the same point, about 46, making the triple bottom"
"look like a double top. This pattern, too, fails to come to fruition when prices"
"reach the 37 support zone and turn around. The double top remains uncon-"
"firmed and it just becomes another two bumps on the price chart."

"Focus on Failures"
"Once price reaches the confirmation line, it usually has been rising for about a"
"month, on average, since the third bottom. Price often pierces the resistance line"
"but doubles back, hesitating before continuing up—most of the time. In some"
"cases, price rises above the confirmation point by less than 5% before throwing"
"back and continuing down. When that happens, it is called a 5% failure. In this"
"study of triple bottoms, all chart patterns must stage an upward breakout (a rise"
"above the highest high in the formation) before being labeled a triple bottom."
"Since all formations have upward breakouts, only 5% failures remain to wipe the"
"warm glow of a successful investment from a novice investor’s face. Fortunately,"
"5% failures are rare. Figure 50.3 shows an example of such a failure."
"The formation is a triple bottom since price rises above the confirmation"
"line in mid-September. But the rise is brief—only 1 day has a close above the"
"confirmation line before price tumbles."
"What are the signs of a budding failure? In this situation, the curved rise"
"leading to the triple bottom suggests a rounding top. The volume pattern is"
"suspiciously flat, but an irregular or abnormal pattern is common and should"
"not automatically disqualify a formation. Perhaps the most likely failure is not"
"one of performance but of identification. Are the three bottoms well separated,"
"each a significant minor low in its own right? Are the low prices near to one"
"another without the center bottom being meaningfully below the other two?"
"As you look at the formation, it should take on a striking appearance and"
"almost shout, “Yes, I am a triple bottom!” There should be something familiar,"
"a special quality that distinguishes a valid triple bottom from any other three-"
"lump configuration. If it does not scream, “Buy me!” then you should probably"
"look elsewhere."

"Three large distinct tops    Look for three minor highs, well separated and distinct. The"
"tall peaks are often sharp spikes that contrast with more"
"rounding-appearing valleys."
"Same price                   The price variation among the three tops is minor. The"
"center top should not be significantly above the other two,"
"otherwise it is a head-and-shoulders top. There is a"
"tendency for smaller triple tops to be one of the"

"angle variety, so pay attention to the price lows, too."
"Downward volume              The volume trend is usually downward but may be hard to"
"trend                       read. Often the volume pattern is flat except near each of"
"the three peaks. The first peak often has the highest volume."
"Confirmation point           Prices must decline below the lowest low in the formation"
"(the confirmation point) or it is not a triple top. An up-"

"In the case of a right-angled broadening top, you can probably make money"
"on the triple top formation even before the broadening top breaks out. At least"
"with a broadening formation, you can anticipate when it will be time to close out"
"your position (do so when prices approach the lower, down-sloping, trend line)."
"Same price. The three peaks in a triple top usually are sharp and pointed"
"looking, with rounded-appearing valleys in between. There are wide varia-"
"tions in this pattern, so do not be too critical. Make sure the three well-sepa-"
"rated peaks are not part of the same congestion pattern. Each top should be a"
"part of its own minor high, a distinct peak that towers above the surrounding"
"price landscape. The price difference between the three peaks is usually minor,"
"with the center peak often below the other two. A large price variation should"
"exclude the pattern from consideration."
"Downward volume trend. The overall volume trend is usually down-"
"ward and lackluster, but varies from formation to formation. Volume on the"
"three peaks, especially the first one, is higher than in the valleys."
"Confirmation point. The three-bump pattern confirms as a triple top"
"when price closes below the lowest low in the pattern. Without confirmation,"
"you do not have a triple top and price is likely to continue rising. Alternatively,"
"an up-sloping trend line drawn across the bottoms of the two valleys can also"
"serve as confirmation. Often, this approach will allow you to enter a trade sooner."
"To see what a triple top looks like, examine Figure 51.2. The three peaks"
"are pointed, well separated, and distinct. The three minor highs are obvious"
"and that is important in any formation. If other investors do not recognize a"
"chart pattern for what it is, they will not try to take advantage of it. If they do"
"not buy or sell appropriately, the pattern will fail. Chart patterns are a self-"
"fulfilling prophecy that depend on the crowd behaving the same way."
"All three peaks are at about the same price level with the center peak a bit"
"recessed from the other two. This feature is common as quite a number (25%)"
"of triple tops have a lower center peak."
"The receding volume trend is clear in the figure with the first peak wit-"
"nessing the highest volume of the three."
"An interesting development in this formation is a trend line drawn below"
"the lows (not shown but it connects points A and B on the chart). With another"
"trend line drawn horizontally across the three tops, the formation takes on the"
"appearance of a right-angled descending broadening top. In many triple tops, the"
"broadening formation also appears. This occurrence does not diminish the valid-"
"ity of the triple top; it just makes both formations easier to trade (because you can"
"buy or sell at the trend lines and take advantage of partial rises or declines)."
"Weekly chart. The larger triple tops appear on the weekly scale, and Fig-"
"ure 51.3 shows an example. Even though the average triple top sports a 19% to"
"24% decline, price occasionally falls much farther. As you can see in the chart,"
"the triple top marks the peak in the stock. From the high of 32.94, the stock"
"plummets to 4.75, a stomach-churning decline of 86% in 2 years."

"consolidations of the prevailing trend. Like the wedge shown in Figure 52.2,"
"prices are heading upward when they run into turbulence. Investors pause from"
"their buying spree and sit on the sidelines. Price retraces its rise by creating the"
"wedge, oscillating in ever-narrowing spirals, until the buying enthusiasm"
"resumes. Volume shows this lack of enthusiasm as it recedes. When buying"
"momentum resumes, price and volume shoot upward again after the breakout."
"Think of a falling wedge not as a pattern of weakness, but one of strength,"
"a spring winding tighter and tighter. As a spring tightens, it shrinks, and so do"
"price and volume in the falling wedge. During a breakout, the pent-up force"
"releases, and price bursts through the formation boundary and zooms upward."
""

"Focus on Failures"
"Like many formations, falling wedges suffer from 5% failures (see Figure 52.3)."
"The falling wedge acts as a reversal of the upward trend. Although not shown"
"on the chart, price began rising in early December 1994. During creation of"
"the chart pattern, price moved lower in a narrowing channel. After the break-"
"out, price climbed and reach a high of 45.38, less than 5% above the breakout"
"price of 43.25. From the high, price headed down and reached the ultimate low"
"in late October at a price of 36.38. The inability of price to continue rising"
"more than 5% after the breakout constituted a 5% failure."
"The causes of 5% failures can be many. Overhead resistance, as in this case,"
"blocked the upward rise, so be sure to check for resistance before trading. For"
"downward breakouts, look for nearby underlying support that may halt a decline."
"Other causes may include a sharp drop in the stock market—that can"
"keep an industry down for months (think of airline stocks after the tragedy of"
"September 11, 2001). Certainly, a switch from a bull market to a bear market"
"will tend to keep high-flying stocks cruising at a lower altitude, but even a short"
"decline in the market can cause havoc."
"Rising commodity prices affect the stock market, too. For example, nat-"
"ural gas and oil prices affect airlines, chemicals, utilities, oil companies, oil"
"service companies, refiners, and so on. The Federal Reserve raising interest"

"Trading Tactics"

"in the formation. Prices reach that 70% of the time in a bull market and 60%"
"of the time in a bear market. Figure 52.4 shows an example."
"The highest price is just as the formation starts in early June at 48.63, and"
"it becomes the target price. After the breakout, price hesitates and attempts a"
"throwback to the formation trend line, but cannot quite reach it. After that, it"
"is straight up. Price reaches the target in early August. The old high is a place"
"of resistance and it takes about 2 weeks before price is able to push decidedly"
"above that level. Price moves higher until hitting 51 before stumbling and"
"entering an extended downtrend."
"For downward breakouts, I used the formation height subtracted from"
"the breakout price to compute a target. For example, the falling wedge shown"
"in Figure 52.4 has a high of 48.63 and a low of 44.38. The height is the differ-"

"sured move up chart pattern. Not shown is the first up-leg but the decline"
"between the two up-legs begins in late September, and a portion of it shows in"
"the figure."

"between 5 and 25 days to reach the top of the bounce."
"Decline. After price peaks during the bounce, it drops, falling slowly,"

"worse after prices finish bouncing higher. Table 54.5 shows that prices decline"
"between 18% (bull market) and 27% (bear market) below the event low. Do"
"you want to risk those additional losses?"
"Since you cannot avoid the event decline, ride it out, and wait for the"
"bounce. Use Tables 54.6 and 54.7 to estimate how long and how far prices are"
"likely to bounce. I have found that an up-sloping trend line drawn along the"
"bottom of the minor lows as prices rise is effective in many cases. When price"
"closes below the trend line, sell. You will not catch the bounce high and prices"
"may resume rising without adding a postbounce decline, but selling is the best"
"way to protect your wealth."
"If you happen to be short the stock and a DCB occurs, expect a bounce"
"followed by an additional decline. Table 54.5 shows that between 67% (bull"
"market) and 75% (bear market) of the stocks showing a DCB will drop below"
"the event low. You may be looking at the exception, so if price rises to close the"
"event gap (between 22% and 23% will, from Table 54.4), consider closing out"
"your short position."

"Sample Trade"
"Consider Figure 54.5, a dead-cat bounce in Cerner Corporation. The stock"
"dropped five points (25%) after the company said earnings would fall short of"
"expectations and the outlook for the remainder of the year was grim. The stock"
"closed higher on each of the next 4 days and then closed lower. Jill, after see-"

"moving down—as predicted."
"The earnings announcement forced the stock down another 20% in 2"
"days. Expecting another dead-cat bounce, Jill held onto her position. The stock"
"rose in an uneven fashion over the next week or so, and then rounded over and"
"headed lower."
"She connected the tops from the preannouncement day onward in a"
"down-sloping trend line. When price eventually closed above the trend line,"
"she knew it was time to close out the position. The next day she bought the"
"stock back and received a fill at 12, 0.25 below the daily close. She sat back and"
"totaled up her profits and realized she made almost $3 a share, or about 20%"
"in just 1 month."
"As good as the trade was, had she waited until November to close out the"

"What does an iDCB pattern look like? Figure 55.1 shows the first example,"
"taken from a trade I made. The inverted dead-cat bounce pattern begins with"
"a large, 1-day upward price move. In this example, the stock jumped 15% after"
"the earnings announcement, gapping upward on high volume. The following"
"day, it made a higher high, low, and close, but over the coming days, price"
"dropped, returning to the launch point and then sinking moderately below it."
"Here is my notebook entry for the trade: “2/6/04. I bought 400 shares,"
"300 filled at 30.30, 100 filled at 30.39. This is an earnings flag trade. I waited"
"for a retrace before buying because of a weak general market. Price may retrace"

"That is also the site of the August–November 2003 peaks. Expect a rise to 35."
"This could stall at 34 according to the point and figure chart. At 35, this goes"
"up against a long-term down trend line from the March and July peaks in"
"2000. According to the 1-2-3 trend change rule, the stock is poised to move up."

"this one. Why? Large down moves often follow large up moves."
"Since the odds of a successful trade improve with a rising stock, industry, and"
"general market, I waited for the market to get on board. The S&P 500 index"
"started moving up a few days before I bought. A retrace to the 27.50–28 area"
"would find support from prior peaks but would also fill the gap. A gap usually sup-"
"ports the stock—as it did in late February—but price tunneled through in March."
"The 35-price target comes from the earnings flag projection. From the"
"low the day before the large up move, price bottomed at 25.24 and then peaked"
"at 31.88 for a height of 6.64. From the flag low at point A, 28.75, the target"
"would be 35.39. I played it conservative and rounded it down to 35."
"A 50% retrace of the up move in the flagpole would put the stock at 28.56,"
"just above the high end of the gap, and just below point A. I find that Fibonacci"
"retracement numbers (such as 38%, 50%, and 62%) come in handy to help"
"determine support and resistance zones. You can see that price approached the"
"50% retrace mark as it made a low at point A and then moved higher."
"Sometimes I check the point and figure (PF) chart to help determine"

"The figure is a frequency distribution of the average price change over"
"time. The vertical axis shows the average climb as measured from low to low,"
"high to high, or close to close between the day before the large move (called"
"the reference day) to succeeding days up to a month later. For example, on day"

"immediately to minimize the loss. If price gaps down and the"

"stock may dead-cat bounce on you, so read Chapter 54. Wait for the bounce"
"and then sell as price rounds over at the top just before a renewed decline."
"Usually the decline from this pattern is not severe (see Table 56.3 to see"

"will do so again next quarter. I verified this prediction by looking at 1,963"

"(after all, this is a good earnings surprise, not a bad one), search for a rising price"
"trend. That way you can ride the wave of a rising tide. It also helps to buy in a"
"bull market."
"Earnings announced. When the company announces earnings, price"
"may move up sharply that day or the next if the announcement came after mar-"
"kets were closed (sometimes price gaps upward). You can find earnings"
"announcements in the newspapers, on the Internet, or on financial television"
"programs. Announcements usually occur quarterly, so add 3 months to the last"
"release to estimate the date of the next release."
"Large intraday range. To be included in the study, the announcement"
"day’s trading range needed to be larger than the 1-month average. The larger"
"the day’s price range, the better the performance (higher average rise with a"
"lower failure rate), on average."

"several days, price will probably pause and form an earnings flag. (See Chapter"

"10% and then tumble by at least 20%. Those are not good odds."

"buy ahead of an earnings announcement. Before I trade, I always check when"
"the next earnings announcement will be (typically, it is 3 months after the last"
"one). If it is within 3 weeks, I will skip the trade because my holding time is"

"Trading Tactics and Sample Trade"
"I do not recommend trading this pattern because the performance is so poor"

"statistical results questionable. However, I do know one thing to be true: The"
"wider the intraday trading range on the announcement (or the next day), the"
"better the performance."
"What does this finding mean? I measured the average trading range for"
"the month leading to the pattern and compared it to the range on the"
"announcement day. In mathematical terms, this is an average of the daily"
"high–low differences of the prior month compared to the high–low range on"
"the announcement day. If the announcement day high–low range (ADHLR)"
"was larger than the average, the pattern tended to outperform. If the ADHLR"
"was twice the average, the pattern did better still with a lower failure rate. When"
"the ADHLR was 3 times the average, it did better still. Thus, look for a wide"
"high–low price range on the day of the announcement for best performance."
"As I mentioned in the Identification Guidelines section, one pattern"
"shows promise. Here are a few statistics regarding an informal study of FDA"
"drug approval patterns meeting the J-shaped identification guidelines."
"I accepted patterns showing a price peak between 21 days and 48 days (3"

"Price climbed smartly after the FDA drug approval, but then topped out at"
"point A, rounded over, and tumbled to the low at 21.19. Point A is 38 days after"
"the approval. The short sale comes after price pierces the up-sloping trend line."
"The decline from the close the day following the trend-line pierce (35.20) to"

"dropped to about 30 and then climbed to A. If you were an experienced trader,"

"stock rocketing upward, usually on the same day as the"
"announcement if the market is open. If too much time passes"
"before the up move, say, more than 2 days, look elsewhere."
"Flagpole                  Price usually climbs in a near vertical run."
"Flag                      After leaving the flagpole, price trends downward, but not"
"always. Price might meander upward or horizontally and it"
"might not look like a rectangular flag at all. Expect any"
"shape. The flag should look like a consolidation region"
"separate from the vertical flagpole run."
"Breakout                  Price pierces the flag rectangle border, moving upward. If"
"the flag portion has an irregular shape, use a close above the"
"highest high."
"Confirmation price        Confirmation is the price at which the earnings flag becomes"
"a valid pattern. For testing, I used a close above the highest"
"high in the formation as the confirmation price, but price"

"might send it up, but why chance it? Stick to flags in a rising price trend and"
"that way your wallet can float on the rising tide."
"Do not get excited about small gaps. I am talking about area gaps. When"
"an earnings flag occurs, sometimes price gaps upward. Usually, in a few days,"

"to the target price or lower, but getting there may be bumpy. It may be that"

"For example, suppose a stock shows a 3S pattern with an intraday high of"

"goes negative, then ignore it. Chances are your stock will not go bankrupt."
"If the decline seems unusually large, check Table 60.3. In this example,"
"the $2 decline represents a 25% drop from 8. What are the chances that the"
"stock will fall that far? According to Table 60.3, 86% of the stocks in a bull"

"well-behaved bullish chart patterns have break-even failure rates in the single"
"digits. The average rise is a weak 23% and 14% in bull and bear markets,"
"respectively, as measured from the breakout price."

"Identification Guidelines"
"Identifying 3S patterns is simple; you just read the newspaper or listen to the"
"financial news on television. On the day of the announcement, look for a large"
"price swing (a wide trading range). Prices should move up, perhaps even gap"
"upward. If they do not move much or if the trading range is unremarkable,"
"then keep looking. Figure 61.2 shows three examples of good patterns."
"In the first two cases, the daily low is near the prior day’s high. In the"
"August example, price gaps upward. We are looking for good news that surprises"
"the market, boosting the price. How you choose to define a large move is up to"
"you. I included days that gapped upward or had a large trading range that day or"
"the following day. Why the next day? Because the markets may be closed during"
"the announcement and any price move would occur the next day. If the stock did"
"not react to the announcement, I ignored it. Table 61.1 lists what to look for."
"Announcement. I learn of same-store sales announcements from the"
"newspaper. Occasionally they appear on television, especially for the larger"
"retailers. The Internet is also a source of 3S news."

"Measure rule. Consult Figure 61.5 to apply the measure rule. In the"
"April announcement, price ranged from an intraday high of 17.17 to a low of"
"15.17, for a height of 2. Add the height to the high to get a target price of"
"19.17. In this example, price topped out 3 days later at a price of 17.92, well"
"short of the target. However, in 82% of the bull market cases I looked at (and"
"72% in a bear market), price reached or exceeded the target before declining"
"substantially (more than 20%)."
"Buy signal. The buy signal is a close above the intraday high posted on the"
"announcement day. Since the 3S pattern consists of 1 day, it should not take"
"long for price to wander off . . . typically 4 days (from Table 61.4). I do not"

"Trading Tactics"
""
"Trading Tactic               Explanation"
"Measure rule                 Used to predict a target price. Using the day of the"
"announcement, compute the height by subtracting the daily"
"low from the daily high. Add the result to the daily high for the"
"target price. Price reaches the target 82% and 72% of the time"
"in bull and bear markets, respectively."
"Buy signal                   Buy when price closes above the formation high and use a stop-"
"loss order to protect profits."
"Sell signal                  Expect to take profits in a week or two. Sell when price starts"
"heading down."
"Short the stock              After the upward breakout, price should reach the ultimate high"
"quickly. Once they start heading back down, sell short. Watch"
"for a throwback to stall price near support zones (including the"
"announcement day gap). Protect your position with stops."
"932     Same-Store Sales, Good"

"recommend buying a stock just because it posted a good same-store sales num-"
"ber. Chances are the stock will tumble below the buy price in a few weeks."
"Sell signal. When to sell is a difficult topic to cover in just a few para-"
"graphs. Price should climb and then start rounding over in a week or two."
"When you sense the top has occurred and price is heading down, sell, or at"
"least tighten up a stop. If price continues dropping, the stop will take you out."
"If you fail to sell, the decline after the ultimate high averages 28% in a bull"
"market and 31% in a bear market, well above the 23% and 14% bull and bear"
"rises posted by the 3S pattern. Thus, you give back all of your gains and more."
"If you own the stock and the company announces good same-store sales,"
"then watch the stock carefully. If it breaks out downward, consult Chapter 60"
"for more information. If it breaks out upward with gusto, watch for price to"
"peak in a week or two and then start heading back down. If the stock peaks, the"
"decline might be a massive one, so consider selling then. If you are in a raging"
"bull market and you like the company, then hold the stock, especially if it is"
"near the yearly low (the best performing 3S patterns start there). Eventually"
"the stock is going to go down, just keep raising your stop until it takes you out."
"Short the stock. Shorting a stock is a risky play as it depends on correctly"
"predicting the top in a stock. If you suspect price has reached its high and is"
"now heading down, consider selling short. Use a stop to protect yourself and"
"have good reasons based on both fundamental and technical analysis before"
"you place the trade. With this pattern, the top usually—but not always—comes"
"quickly."

"Sample Trade"
"Look at Figure 61.5 for a sample trade. Ann Taylor announces same-store"
"sales on a monthly basis. Thus, you have plenty of trading opportunities each"
"year. The patterns marked on the chart are all valid 3S chart patterns. They"
"have upward breakouts and they gap upward or show an above average trading"
"range on the announcement day or the day after."
"In the April announcement, price climbs and rounds over in a week and"
"tumbles, ending well below the close the day before the announcement. That"
"curling action is an example of a throwback. The May announcement shows an"
"upward price gap, price rises for another day and then it retraces in a flag pat-"
"tern. After the flag, price resumes its climb in a stair-step manner. The June 3S"
"pattern is similar to April, only wider. Price rounds over and finds support at"
"the announcement day gap. Most of the time (91%), price will stop before"
"reaching the bottom of the gap."
"The July pattern looks a lot like the April pattern, including the decline"
"afterward. The August pattern behaves like the May pattern, with a rise-retrace"
"climb. The September climb is a wider version of April, and so is the Novem-"
"ber pattern."

"On this chart, we have five patterns that behave similarly (April, June,"
"July, September, and November) with the other two showing extended rises."
"These patterns suggest that you avoid buying a stock expecting a long rise"
"after a 3S pattern. A better plan is to actively trade the 3S pattern by buying"
"quickly, riding it upward for a few days, and then selling. Alternatively, wait for"
"price to top out and then short the stock."
"Before you short a stock using the 3S pattern, use a sheet of paper to"
"cover each figure in the chapter and slowly move it to the right. Decide where"
"you would short a stock after the 3S pattern. Then move the sheet to the right"
"and see where you would cover the short. How did you do?"
"Practice on stocks you follow to get comfortable with the idea. Hone"
"your skills and test your trading technique on paper before trying it in the mar-"
"ketplace with real money. The 3S pattern is a risky way to short a stock, but it"
"is easy to do. The tough part is making money doing it."

"announces surprisingly good same-store sales, use a stop to protect yourself."

"• Avoid this pattern in a bear market as 27% fail to rise more than 5%,"

"Table 62.2 shows general statistics gathered in over 500 stocks from 1995 to"
"mid-2004. Many of the stocks did not have downgrades as the companies were"
"too small for analysts to follow, and if they did follow them, the downgrade did"
"not make the news. Other companies were both popular and newsworthy."
"Number of formations. I found more downgrades with downward"

"Measure rule. Use the measure rule to predict the target price. First,"
"find the height on the downgrade day by subtracting the intraday low from the"

"breakouts, subtract it from the intraday low. The result is the target price, the"
"minimum expected price move. The Result Snapshot (“Percentage meeting"
"price target”) shows how often this method works."
"Buy signal. Do not buy a stock after a broker downgrade unless you have"
"a compelling reason to do so. In many cases, the downgrade may be near a"
"trend change (from down to up), meaning that the downgrade often comes"
"near the yearly low, just as price is about to recover. Wait for it to bottom and"
"then buy cautiously as more downside may become apparent."
"Sell signal—down breakouts. If you own the stock, sell immediately, or"

"compute the height by subtracting the intraday low from the"

"high; for downward breakouts subtract it from the daily low."
"The result is the target price. This method works between 64%"
"and 71% of the time."
"Buy signal             None. Do not buy after a broker downgrades the stock. Most"
"likely, price is going to drop."
"Sell signal—down       For downward breakouts, sell a long holding immediately or sell"
"breakouts            after price turns down after a pullback."
"Sell signal—up         Price peaks in 1 to 3 weeks after the downgrade, so consider"
"breakouts            selling as price rounds over after an upward breakout."
"Short the stock—       Selling short is risky and downgrades are not reliable short"
"down breakouts       candidates. Too often, price drops for a week or two and then"
"recovers. If you still want to short, sell immediately and use"
"stops to limit losses. The best performance comes from"
"downgrades within a third of the yearly low, so check for that."
"Short the stock—       If the breakout is upward, watch the stock as it climbs. It may"

"to protect your wallet (or purse). See Sample Trade—Upward"

"the decline may be behind you already. In many cases I have looked at, the"

"out gives a good example of how to trade a downgrade when the breakout is"
"upward. What you want to do is watch from shore as price rises, then jump in"
